This  manual  was  designed  to  help  custodians  of  personal  health  information  meet
their  obligations  under  the  Personal  Health  Information  Act.    Under  the  Act,  all
custodians  of  personal  health  information  are  required  to  have  policies  and
procedures  in  place  that  facilitate  the  implementation  of,  and  ensure  compliance
with  the  Personal  Health  Information  Act.    This  manual  is  intended  to  provide
custodians with a framework for developing their own policies and procedures.

Who should use this Manual
Who should use this Manual
Who should use this Manual
Who should use this Manual

The  Personal Health  Information Act  requires that  all custodians  of  personal  health
information  have  policies  and  procedures  to  ensure  that  they  comply  with  the
requirements  of the  Act.    Any  custodian  who  is  developing  new  policies  or  updating
existing policies may use this manual to assist them as they do so.

In  addition,  the  information  in  this  policy  development  manual  may  be  useful  for
decision  makers,
information  managers,  direct  care  providers,  employees,
volunteers,  vendors  and  those  with  practicing  privileges  within  an  organization
operated by a custodian.

How to use this Manual
How to use this Manual
How to use this Manual
How to use this Manual

This policy development manual is a starting point.  It is intended to assist custodians
as they create or update their own policies and procedures.  The manual sets out the
legal requirements of the Personal Health Information Act and arranges them into a
policy development framework.

The  manual  provides  custodians  with  sample  language  for  policies  and  for
procedures:    the  sample  policy  language  provided  reflects  custodians’  obligations
under the Personal Health Information Act; the sample procedure language contains
suggestions as to how the sample policies could be implemented.  Custodians should
not  simply  adopt  the  sample  policies  and  procedures  in  this  policy  development
manual  as  their  own;  rather,  custodians  should  review  the  samples  provided  and
adapt  them  to  make  them  applicable  to  their  particular  activities  and  lines  of
business.

The Personal Health Information Act does not require health information custodians
to  completely  set  aside  their  existing  information  practices.  Where  a  custodian
already  has  a  set  of  policies  and  procedures,  the  Act  may  simply  necessitate  a
change  to  existing  information-handling  practices  to  make  existing  policies  and
procedures compliant with the new requirements of the Personal Health Information
Act.    Regardless  of  whether  a  custodian  is  creating  a  full  set  of  policies  and
procedures  or  simply  updating  an  existing  set  it  is  important  that  a  custodian’s
policies  and  procedures  accurately  describe  the  ways  that  they  collect,  use  and
disclose personal information in their custody.  Custodians should say what they do

Government of Newfoundland and Labrador
Department of Health and Community Services

12

and do what they say:  policies are official statements, and custodians will be held to
what they say in them.

It  should  always  be  kept  in  mind  that  while  custodians  may  customize  the  sample
language provided in this manual, custodians should always be careful to ensure that
whatever  policies  or  procedures  they  develop  are  legally  compliant  with  the
requirements  of  the  Personal  Health  Information  Act.    This  manual  should  not  be
construed  as  legal  advice;  it  is  only  a  policy  and  procedure  development  aid.
Custodians  should  consult  the  Act,  their  regulatory  authority  and  /  or  solicitor  for
interpretation of or for guidance on the provisions of the Personal Health Information
Act, where necessary and as applicable.

The manual contains a glossary of commonly-used terms as well as brief discussion
papers expanding on some of the more common questions that arise under the Act.
The discussion materials can be found in the appendices at the end of the manual.

There may be significant legal issues to consider regarding the laws of the receiving
jurisdiction, as they could impact the collection, use and disclosure of information in
that  jurisdiction.    Custodians  should  engage  persons  with  sufficient  subject-matter
expertise to conduct an assessment of the receiving jurisdiction’s laws as they relate

Consent  is  considered  knowledgeable  if  it  is  reasonable  in  the  circumstances  to
believe that when the individual gave consent they were informed:

1.  of the purpose of the collection, use and disclosure of the information;
2.  that  they  may  withdraw  their  consent  (where  consent  is  required  for  the

collection, use or disclosure); and

3.  that  the  information  may  only  be  collected,  used  or  disclosed  without  their

persons providing necessary services that form an individual’s health care team.

Implied consent is permitted when a custodian or representative of the custodian is
sharing  an  individual’s  personal  health  information  for  the  purpose  of  providing
health  care  or  assisting  in  the  provision  of  health  care  as  part  of  the  circle  of  care
unless the individual has expressly withdrawn their consent.

A custodian must protect the personal health information of individuals as required
by an individual’s consent directives.

Consent  directives  limiting  consent  must  be  obtained  by  a  custodian,  or  where
applicable, their designate.

Consent  directives  limiting  consent  are  valid  for  as  long  as  the  subject  information
exists,  unless  the  limitation  is  revoked  by  the  individual.  Consent  directives  limiting
consent survive disclosure to another custodian.

Consent directives limiting consent do not prohibit or restrict a recording of personal
health  information  by  the  custodian  where  the  recording  is  required  by  law  or  by
standards of professional or institutional practice.

Where  a  custodian  discloses  information  to  another  custodian  for  the  purpose  of
providing health care and the disclosing custodian does not have the consent of the
individual  to  disclose  all  personal  health  information  about  the  individual  that  they
feel  is  reasonably  necessary  for  the  receiving  custodian’s  purpose,  the  disclosing
custodian must inform the receiving custodian that restrictions have been placed on
the disclosure by the individual.

When  an  individual  provides  a  consent  directive  that  limits  the  way  in  which  a
custodian may collect, use or disclose their information, the custodian will:

•  Require the individual to complete, date and sign a form that identifies to the
custodian the specific conditions placed on the collection, use or disclosure of
their personal health information.

•  Ensure  that  the  individual  is  informed  of  how  the  specific  consent  directive
limiting collection, use  or disclosure may impact the individual’s health care,
including risks to the provision of the best possible care.

•  Ensure that the documentation related to the individual’s consent directive is

featured prominently in the individual’s health record.

Where  an  individual  consents  to  the  collection,  use  or  disclosure  of  their  personal
health information, the  individual may withdraw their consent, whether it is express
or implied, by providing notice to the custodian.

The withdrawal of the consent will not have retroactive effect.

Withdrawal of consent can only be obtained by a custodian, or, where applicable, the
appointed contact person or designate, as defined in policies 2.50 (“Designate”) and
2.60 (“Contact Person”).

Consent  directives  limiting  or  withdrawing  consent  do  not  have  the  effect  of
restricting collection, use or disclosure required or permitted by law.

Consent directives limiting or withdrawing consent do not have the effect restrict the
recording  of  personal  health  information  required  by  standards  of  professional  or
institutional practice.

Custodians are responsible for informing individuals that:

•  Whether express or implied, where consent is required for a collection, use or

disclosure it may be withdrawn by the individual at any time;

•  Withdrawal of consent is effective as of the date of its withdrawal but will not

have a retroactive effect;

•  Withdrawal of consent may have an adverse impact on the provision of care to

the individual, including risks arising from delay; and

Disclosure  of  personal  health  information  can,  under  certain  limited circumstances,
be disclosed without an individual’s consent.

The circumstances under which information can be disclosed without an individual’s
consent are those that are permitted or required by the Personal Health Information
Act.

There are two categories of situation in which disclosure without consent may occur;
discretionary  disclosure  and  mandatory  disclosure.    Sections  A  and  B,  below,  deal
with  discretionary  disclosures  that  may  be  made  without  consent,  while  section  C

Prior  to  collecting  personal  health  information  from  an  individual,  custodians  are
required  to  notify  individuals  of  the  purpose  for  which  their  information  is  being
collected,  and  of  all  reasonably  foreseeable  uses  and  disclosures.    (See  sample
policy 1.70, “Notification of Uses and Public Statements”).

A custodian must not collect personal health information about an individual unless:

•

•

The  individual  who  is  the  subject  of  the  information  has  consented  to  its
collection and the collection is necessary for a lawful purpose; or

The  collection  is  permitted  or  required  by  the  Personal  Health  Information
Act.

As  is  permitted  under the Personal  Health  Information Act,  a custodian  may  collect
personal  health  information  about  an  individual  without  that  individual's  consent

Government of Newfoundland and Labrador
Department of Health and Community Services

57

where the individual is incapable of providing consent and the collection is necessary
for the provision of health care to the individual when:

•  There  is  no  authorized  representative  who  can  provide  consent  on  behalf  of

the individual or, consent cannot be obtained in a timely manner; or

•  The individual has been certified as an involuntary patient or is the subject of
a  community  treatment  order  under  the  Mental  Health  Care  and  Treatment
Act.

A  custodian  must  not  collect  personal  health  information  if  other  information  will
serve the purpose of the collection, unless the custodian is required by law to collect
the information.

Except  as  provided  for  in  PHIA,  as  described  in  sample  policy  3.20  (“Indirect
Collection of Personal Health Information”), a custodian must collect personal health
information directly from the individual who is the subject of the information.

A  custodian  must  not  collect  more  personal  health  information  than  is  reasonably
necessary to meet the purpose of the collection unless there is a legal requirement to
collect that information.

Consent  directives  limiting  or  withdrawing  consent  do  not  have  the  effect  of
restricting  the  recording  of  personal  health  information  required  by  standards  of
professional or institutional practice.

Where the requested personal health information is outside the access provisions of
the  Personal  Health  Information  Act,  the  custodian  must  inform  the  individual  in
writing that the request is refused and why.

The custodian must also inform the individual that they may appeal the refusal to the
Trial  Division  or  request  a  review  of  the  refusal  by  the  Information  and  Privacy
Commissioner.

The custodian is required to respond to the access request from the individual in a
prompt manner and within sixty days of receiving the request. An extension of thirty
(30)  days  is  available  when  the  request  meets  the  following  criteria  and  the
custodian  has  informed  the  individual  in  writing  of  the  reasons  for  the  needed
extension:

•  Meeting  the  sixty  (60)  day  time  limit  would  unreasonably  interfere  with  the

operations of the custodian; or

•  The  information  consists  of  numerous  records  or  locating  the  information

cannot be completed within the time limit.

The custodian may grant or refuse the individual's request as soon as possible and in
any event not later than the expiration of the time limit as extended.

The custodian may provide personal health information to an individual from a record
that  is  not  a  record  dedicated  primarily  to  personal  health  information  about  the
individual  who  is  requesting  access,  by  severing  all  additional  information  from  the
record prior to providing access.

If after reasonable efforts the requested record is not located or does not exist, the
custodian must inform the individual in writing of this fact.

Where  a  custodian  fails  to  respond  to  a  request  for  access  within  the  sixty  (60)  or
ninety  (90)  day  time  period  he  or  she  must  be  considered  to  have  refused  the
request  for  access  and the  individual  requesting  access  may  appeal  that  refusal to

In  these  situations,  other  acceptable  methods  of  facilitating  access

•  Where  possible,  the  request  should  identify  when  the  personal  health

information would have been collected, used and/or disclosed;

•  The  request  must  contain  sufficient  information  to  allow  for  information

retrieval with reasonable effort;

•  The requester must be agreeable to any fees related to the request; and
•  The  individual  when  presenting  to  review  the  personal  health  information

must provide two pieces of identification.

Requests for access to personal health information must be dated when received.

The custodian must contact the individual to clarify the request if the information on
the request form is incomplete or unclear.

The  custodian,  if  requested  by  the  individual,  may  provide  a  copy  of  the  personal
health information.

requests  for  correction  or  amendment  of  records  containing  personal  health
information.

SAMPLE

Where  a  custodian  has  granted  an  individual  access  to  a  record  containing  their
personal  health  information,  and  where  the  individual  believes  that  the  record  is
inaccurate  or  incomplete, the  individual  may  request that the  custodian  correct the
information.

Custodians may accept a request for correction or amendment from the individual in
either oral or written form. Requests must contain the following information:

•  The individual’s

o  Name;
o  Date of birth;
o  MCP number, or other unique identifier; and
o  Address.

•  Sufficient information to allow for record retrieval with reasonable effort, such
as the dates the personal health information would have been collected, used
and/or disclosed.

The custodian is required to respond to the access request from the individual in a
prompt manner and within thirty (30) days of receiving the request. An extension of
thirty  (30)  days  is  available  when  the  request  meets  the  following  criteria  and  the
custodian  has  informed  the  individual  in  writing  of  the  reasons  for  the  needed
extension:

Government of Newfoundland and Labrador
Department of Health and Community Services

94

•  Meeting  the  thirty  (30)  day  time  limit  would  unreasonably  interfere  with  the

operations of the custodian; or

•  The information that is the subject of the correction or amendment request is
located in numerous records and cannot be completed within the time limit.

The  custodian  may  grant  or  refuse  the  individual's  request  for  correction  or
amendment as soon as possible and in any event not later than the expiration of the
time limit as extended.

The custodian cannot charge a fee to an individual when requesting a correction of
their personal health information.

The custodian must grant the request for correction where the individual making the
request  demonstrates  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  custodian  that  the  record  is
incomplete  or  inaccurate  for  the  purposes  for  which  the  custodian  uses  the
information,  and  provides  the  custodian  the  information  necessary  to  enable  the
custodian to correct the record; or

The  custodian  may  refuse  to  grant  the  request  for  correction  in  the  following
situations:

•  The record was not originally created by the custodian and the custodian does
not have sufficient knowledge, expertise and authority to correct the record;
•  The information which is the subject of the request consists of a professional
opinion  or  observation  that  a  custodian  has  made  in  good  faith  about  the
individual; or

•  The  custodian  believes  on  reasonable  grounds  that  the  request  is  frivolous,

vexatious or made in bad faith.

Where a custodian fails to respond to a request for correction or amendment within
the  thirty  (30)  or  sixty  (60)  day  time  period  he  or  she  shall  be  considered  to  have
refused  the  request  for  correction  and  the  individual  requesting  correction  may
appeal  that  refusal  to  the  Trial  Division  or  request  a  review  of  the  refusal  by  the
Information and Privacy Commissioner.

Where  a  request  for  a correction  is  granted, the  custodian  will  make the  requested
correction by recording the correct information in the record and:

•  Striking out the incorrect information in a manner that does not obliterate the

record, or

•  Where  it  is  not  possible  to  strike  out  the  incorrect  information,  label  the
information as incorrect, sever the incorrect information from the record, store
the  incorrect  information  separately  from  the  record,  and  maintain  a  link  in
the record that enables a person to trace the incorrect information, or

•  where  it  is  not  possible  to  record  the  correct  information  in  the  record,  by
ensuring that there is a practical system in place to inform a person accessing

Government of Newfoundland and Labrador
Department of Health and Community Services

95

the  record  that  the  information  in  the  record  is  incorrect  and  to  direct  the
person to the correct information.

Where a request for a correction is granted, the custodian will provide written notice
to  the  individual  who  made  the  request  for  correction  of  the  specific  action  taken.
The  custodian  must  also  provide  written  notice  of  the  requested  correction,  to  the
extent  reasonably  possible,  to  a  person  to  whom  the  custodian  has  disclosed  the
information  within  the  12  month  period  immediately  preceding  the  request  for
correction, unless the custodian reasonably believes that the correction will not have
an impact on the ongoing provision of health care or other benefits to the individual
or  where  the  individual  requesting  the  correction  has  advised  that  notice  is  not
necessary.

Where a custodian refuses to grant a request for correction they must:

•  Annotate  the  personal  health  information  with  the  correction  that  was
requested and not made and, where practicable, notify a person to whom the
information was disclosed within the 12 month period immediately preceding
the  request  for  correction  of  the  notation  unless  the  custodian  reasonably
expects that the notation will not have an impact on the ongoing provision of
health care or other benefits to the individual or the individual requesting the
correction has advised that notice is not necessary; and

•  Provide  the  individual  requesting  the  correction  with  a  written  notice  setting
out  the  correction  that  the  custodian  has  refused  to  make,  the  refusal
together with reasons for the refusal, and the right of the individual to appeal
the  refusal  to  the  Trial  Division  or  request  a  review  of  the  refusal  by  the
Information and Privacy Commissioner.

It  is the  responsibility  of  custodians to  ensure  compliance  with the Personal  Health
Information Act in relation to their operations and also in relation to the activities of
persons and/or entities acting under their authority, such as employees, volunteers
or contractors.

Key  criteria  for  establishing  an  effective  compliance  program  which  would  be
reasonably  capable  of  reducing  the  prospect  of  breaching  the  Personal  Health
Information Act are:

-  Oversight by high-level personnel;
-  Exercising  due  care  in  delegating  substantial  discretionary  authority  (i.e.,
exercising  the  degree  of  care that  an  ordinary  and  reasonable  person  would
normally exercise under circumstances like those at issue);

-  Effective  communication  to  all  levels  of  employees,  volunteers  and  /  or

contractors;

-  Taking  reasonable  steps  to  achieve  compliance,  which  include  systems  for
monitoring,  auditing,  and  reporting  suspected  wrongdoing  without  fear  of
reprisal;

In conducting a review, the commissioner may receive and accept any evidence and
other information that the commissioner sees  fit, whether on oath or  by affidavit or
otherwise, and whether or not it is or would be admissible in a court of law.

In conducting a review, the commissioner may:

(a)

demand  from the  custodian  a  copy  of  a  book,  record  or  document  or
extract from a book, record or document relevant to the subject-matter
of the review;

use a data storage, processing or retrieval device or system belonging
to  the  custodian  under  investigation  in  order  to  produce  a  record  in
readable  form  of  a  book,  record  or  other  document  relevant  to  the
subject-matter of the review.

A  custodian  having  custody  of  a  record,  book  or  document  requested  by  the
commissioner must make a copy and produce it to the commissioner and must, on
the  request  of  the  commissioner,  provide  whatever  assistance  is  reasonably
necessary, including using any data storage, processing or retrieval device to produce
a record in readable form.

A custodian must not obstruct the commissioner who is exercising powers under the
Personal Health Information Act or provide the commissioner with false or misleading
information.

A custodian must produce to the commissioner a copy of the information requested
by  the  commissioner  within  14  days  of  receipt  of  the  request,  except  where  it  is
impractical to do so.

Where it is impractical to comply with the commissioner’s request, a custodian may
require the commissioner to examine the original at its site.

Within  15  days  after  receiving  a  report  of  the  commissioner  that  contains  a
recommendation,  the  custodian  must  decide  whether  or  not  to  comply  with  the
recommendation in whole or in part and must give written notice of their decision to
both the commissioner and to the complainant.

Where  a  custodian  decides  not  to  comply  with  a  recommendation  made  by  the
commissioner, in whole or in part, the written response of the custodian must advise
the complainant of their right to appeal to the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and
Labrador,  Trial  Division  under  Part  VII  of  the  Personal  Health  Information  Act  and
must include the time limit for commencement of an appeal provided in that part.

A  custodian  of  personal  health  information  must  ensure  that  a  privacy  audit  is
conducted  on  a  regularly  scheduled  basis  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  physical,

A privacy audit must be conducted as required, but no less frequently than on an
annual basis.

The  management,  executive  or  other  controlling  entity  of  the  custodian  (i.e.,  in
certain  circumstances,  the  custodian  themselves)  must  conduct  /  review  the
results of all privacy audits.

The  results  of  a  privacy  audit  must  be  incorporated  into  a  custodian’s  risk
management  strategy.  This  may  include  effecting  revisions  to  a  custodian’s
privacy
impact  assessment(s),  policy  statement(s),  and  /  or  physical  or

Templates  for  a  privacy  impact  assessment  and  a  privacy  audit  are  included  in  the
PHIA  Risk  Management  Toolkit  as  produced  by  the  Newfoundland  and  Labrador
Department of Health and Community Services.

Risk  management  activities  such  as  conducting  privacy  impact  assessments  and
privacy  audits  allow  a  custodian  to  identify  and  understand  the  risks  to  which  it  is
exposed, and should enable it to implement controls sufficient to mitigate that risk.

Information security management is the process by which information confidentiality,
integrity, and availability are safeguarded and ensured.  No one product, process or
technology  alone  can  provide  for  every  information  security  issue  faced  by  a
custodian;  rather,  effective  information  security  requires  the  successful  integration
of:

Introduction
Introduction
Introduction
Introduction

Under  the  Newfoundland  and  Labrador  Personal  Health  Information  Act  (PHIA),  a
custodian of personal health information may engage the services of contractors or
service  providers  to  support  their  operations.    Under  certain  circumstances,  where
the engagement requires the contractor or service provider to have access to, use or
disclose  personal  health  information  in  the  custodian’s  control,  a  custodian  is
required by PHIA to enter into a written agreement with that contractor, known as an
Information  Management  Agreement.    The  Information  Management  Agreement
must ensure that the personal health information being accessed by the information
manager is appropriately safeguarded.

This document is intended to provide custodians of personal health information with
some  guidance  regarding  the  main  principles  that  should  be  addressed  when
entering into an agreement with an information manager, as defined under PHIA.

The principles set out in this document are not exhaustive and this document is not
intended to  provide  any  conclusions  regarding the  potential  risks  or  benefits  of  any
particular  service  being  provided  by  an  information  manager.    Each  custodian  of
personal  health  information  should  assess  the  potential  risks  and  benefits  in  the
context  of  their  individual  circumstances.    As  the  stewards  of  very  sensitive
information,  custodians  must  carefully  consider  the  extent  to  which  the  personal
health  information  in  their  custody  or  under  their  control  will  be  used  and  /  or
disclosed  in  the  context  of  a  contract  for  service.    Whenever  personal  health
information is disclosed to an information manager, it is imperative that there be an
agreement  in  place  that  governs  the  accountabilities  for  the  protection  of  the
information.

IIIInformation manager

An  information  manager  is  any  third-party  or  external  contractor  or  service  provider
that  deals  with  a  custodian’s  personal  health  information,  on  behalf  of  that
custodian.    PHIA  defines  an  information  manager  as  being  a  person  or  body,  other
than an employee of a custodian, acting in the course of their employment, that:

(1)  processes,  retrieves,  stores  or  disposes  of  personal  health  information  for

the custodian, or

Government of Newfoundland and Labrador
Department of Health and Community Services

(2)  provides information management or information technology services to the

custodian.

Examples of information managers include contractors or service providers providing:

Information technology services (e.g., software vendors or developers),
Information management services (e.g., records classification)

Information Management Agreements

Information Management Agreements
Information Management Agreements

When a custodian discloses personal health information to an information manager,
the information manager may only use or disclose that information for the purposes
authorized by the agreement.  An agreement with an information manager must be in
writing,  and  has  to  include  clauses  that  provide  for  the  protection  of  the  personal
health  information  the  Information  Manger  will  be  dealing  with  on  behalf  of  the
custodian.  The agreement has to address the protection of the information against
unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disposition, loss or modification, in accordance
with requirements of PHIA.  The agreement must also includes provisions indicating
that they will adhere to both PHIA as well as to the terms of the agreement itself.

This document does not establish either the specific form or the specific contents of
Information  Management  Agreements;  rather,  it  sets  out  some  of  the  main  issues
that  custodians  of  personal  health  information  need  to  carefully  consider  in  the
context  of  engaging  the  services  of  external  contractors  or  service  providers.    The
provisions  or  clauses  of  each  individual  Information  Management  Agreement  will
have to be developed by custodians on a case-by-case basis in order to appropriately
encompass the type and scope of service being provided, and to address the related
privacy and security issues.

This document recognizes that there may be many different scenarios under which a
custodian  might  engage  the  services  of  an  information  manager;  however,    the
principles that underlie and inform the development of the required agreements will
remain  consistent,  regardless  of  the  type  of  service  or  the  scope  of  the  agreement
being developed.  This document is intended to provide an overview of the relevant
principles of information management applicable in multiple contexts, regardless of
the type of contract or agreement that is being considered.

PHIA  states  that  entering  into  an  Information  Management  Agreement  with  an
information manager does not relieve the custodian of its obligations under the Act.
This means that, even though a custodian might, for example, engage the services of
an information manager in respect of the storage of a certain set of personal health
information, the custodian will be considered to be in custody of that information for
legal purposes.  Although the custodian remains in legal custody and control of the

Management  Agreement.    A  custodian  will  be  obligated  to  establish  and  critically
assess  the  means  by  which  an  information  manager  will  protect  the  information
being disclosed to it; it is the responsibility of the information manager to ensure that

obligations  of  the  information  manager  to  maintain  the  accuracy  of  the  personal
health information that is the subject of the agreement, and to notify the custodian in
a timely manner of any errors or other occurrences that might impact on the accuracy
of the information.

Introduction

The  Newfoundland  and  Labrador  Personal  Health  Information  Act  (PHIA)  requires
that custodians take steps that are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that:

1.1.1.1.  Personal health information in their custody or control is protected against

theft, loss and unauthorized access, use or disclosure;

2.2.2.2.  Records containing personal health information in their custody or control are

protected against unauthorized copying or modification; and

3.3.3.3.  Records containing personal health information in their custody or control are

retained, transferred and disposed of in a secure manner.

The  implication  of  this  requirement  is  that  custodians  must  implement  information
security controls to protect the personal health information in their custody or control.
Custodians  must  regard  personal  health  information  in  their  custody  or  control  as
being  perhaps the  most  sensitive  information there can  be  about  an individual  and
must manage the information with due diligence and take appropriate measures to
safeguard it from injury.

The  contents  of this  document  are  intended to  serve  as  a  very  brief  introduction to
information  security  and  to  some  of  the  aspects  of  information  security  that
custodians  of  personal  health  information  may  need  to  consider  in  order  to  fulfill
their responsibilities and obligations under PHIA.

Information  security  is  simply  the  process  by  which  information  confidentiality,
integrity, and availability are safeguarded and ensured.  No one product, process or
technology  alone  can  provide  for  every  information  security  issue  faced  by  a
custodian;  rather,  effective  information  security  requires  the  successful  integration
of:

Controls of all three types must be developed to work in concert with one another in
order to create an effective information security framework.

Personal  health  information  must  be  safeguarded  according  to  baseline  security
requirements  and  continuous  security  risk  management.    Continued  delivery  of
services must be assured through baseline security requirements, including business
continuity planning, and continuous security risk management.

The following is a list of key information security practices that custodians of personal
health  information  should  consider  when  implementing  their  information  security
program.  These practices have been derived from the internationally-recognized ISO
27002 information security standard published by the International Organization for
Standardization  (ISO),  and  represent  the  different  aspects  that  comprise  a
comprehensive information security management program.

It should be noted that while addressing each of the following practices will result in
a comprehensive security framework, custodians may not need to address certain of
the  following,  depending  on  the  nature  and  scope  of  their  operations.    These
practices  should  be  read  as  being  guidelines  to  inform  the  development  and
implementation  of  an  information  security  management  framework:    rather  than
being a comprehensive list of things that custodians must do, these practices should
be viewed as being a list of things that custodians should consider the necessity of,
in the context of their particular work, line of business and / or operations.

The  Newfoundland  and  Labrador  Personal  Health  Information  Act  (PHIA)  requires
that custodians of personal health information establish and implement policies and
procedures that are compliant with the Act regarding the collection, storage, transfer,

In order to be able to properly safeguard informational assets, a custodian must be
able to maintain accurate and up-to-date records of its informational holdings.  One
tool  that  can  assist  with  the  maintenance  of  such  records  is  a  Information  Asset
Profile.    The  purpose  of  an  information  asset  profile  is  to  maintain  on  an  ongoing
basis  a  record  of  key  information  about  a  information  assets  that  can  be  made
available  to  authorized  stakeholders.    Such  stakeholders  might  include  new
employees,  an  organization’s  management  group  or  entities  within  government,
depending on the nature and prescribed uses of the information asset.

An information asset profile is, among other purposes, intended to:

Identify  the  legal  authority  for  collecting  the  information  maintained  in  the
information asset;
Identify  any  uses  and  /  or  disclosures  of  the  information  maintained  in  the

(cid:1)  Assist  in  the  production  of  records  for  persons  requesting  access  to

informational holdings that contain their personal health information.

An  information  asset  profile  should  not  be  produced  a  static  document,  but  should
instead be maintained on an ongoing basis as a “living document”.  An information
asset  profile  should  be  reviewed  on  a  regular,  scheduled  basis  to  ensure  that  the
information relating to the information asset maintained in the profile is current and
accurate.

When  properly  maintained,  Information  Asset  Profiles  will  enable  an  organization to
monitor  what  data  it  is  the  custodian  of  and  to  gauge  at  a  glance  the  level  of
sensitivity of the information assets under its custodianship, which activities can and
should be fed into the organization’s enterprise-level Risk Management strategy.

Introduction
Introduction

The Newfoundland and Labrador Personal Health Information Act (PHIA) sets out the
rules  that  persons  or  organizations  defined  as  custodians  of  personal  health
information must follow when collecting, using, disclosing, retaining and disposing of
personal health information.

PHIA  recognizes  the  unique  character  of  personal  health  information  as  being
extremely  sensitive  and  also  recognizes  that  it  is  frequently  collected,  used  and
disclosed  for  a  variety  of  authorized  purposes.  These  purposes  include  care  and
treatment, health research, quality control and risk management.

PHIA balances individuals’ right to privacy with respect to their own personal health
information with the legitimate needs of health information custodians to collect, use
and  disclose  this  information.  With  certain  limited  exceptions,  PHIA  requires
custodians of personal health information to obtain consent before they collect, use
or disclose the information in their custody or control.  PHIA also makes custodians
responsible  for  the  secure  storage  and  destruction  of  personal  health  information.
Additionally, individuals have the right to access and request correction of their own
personal health information.

The  purpose  of  this  document  is  to  provide  guidance  to  custodians  when  they  are
faced with a privacy breach.

What is a privacy breach?
What is a privacy breach?
What is a privacy breach?
What is a privacy breach?

A  privacy  breach  is  any  collection,  use  or  disclosure  of  personal  health  information
that is not authorized under PHIA.  In essence, a privacy breach occurs whenever a
person  has  contravened  or  is  about  to  contravene  a  provision  of  PHIA,  or  of  the
regulations passed under PHIA.

As  an  example,  section  15  of  PHIA  requires  that  custodians  take  steps  that  are
reasonable  in  the  circumstances  to  ensure  personal  health  information  in  their
custody or control is:

(1) Protected against theft, loss and unauthorized use or disclosure,
(2) Retained, transferred and disposed of in a secure manner; and,

Government of Newfoundland and Labrador
Department of Health and Community Services

137

(3) Protected against unauthorized copying, modification or disposal.

A  failure  to  meet  these  requirements  represents  some  of  the  more  common
circumstances  under  which  a  privacy  breach  could  arise.  Again,  however,  it  is
important  to  bear  in  mind  that  any  collection,  use  or  disclosure  of  personal  health
information  which  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  PHIA  could  also  be  considered  a
breach.

A custodian of personal health information may become aware of a privacy breach in
a  number  of  ways.  It  is  frequently  the  case  that  a  custodian  may  itself  identify  a
breach during the normal course of its business or operations.  A custodian may also
be  contacted  by  the  Newfoundland  and  Labrador  Office  of  the  Information  and
Privacy Commissioner (NL OIPC) if a concern about its operations has been raised by
a member of the public.  Finally, the NL OIPC could initiate its own investigation if it
determined that such was in the public interest.

This appendix will focus primarily on situations where a custodian has itself identified
a  privacy  breach  or  where  the  custodian  has  been  contacted  by  the  NL  OIPC
regarding  a  potential  breach.  Such  situations  often  arise  where  personal  health
information  has  been  stolen,  lost  or  accessed  by  unauthorized  persons.    Many  of
these  situations  will  involve  unintentional  breaches  of  PHIA.    For  example,  personal
health  information  may  be  lost  (a  patient’s  file  is  misplaced),  stolen  (laptop
computers  are  a  prime  example)  or  inadvertently  disclosed  to  an  unauthorized
person  as  a  result  of  an  honest  mistake  (a  letter  addressed to  patient  A  is  actually
mailed to patient B).  However, a custodian may also become aware of breaches that
are  intentional;  for  example,  an  instance  where  intentional,  unauthorized  access  of
patient files by staff has occurred.

Where a privacy breach has occurred, custodians are encouraged to contact the NL
OIPC  so that  assistance  can  be  provided to the  custodian  in  fulfilling its  obligations
under PHIA (e.g. notification of persons involved) and in taking whatever steps might
be necessary to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

It is recommended that a custodian of personal health information develop a privacy
breach “protocol”, or a process for systematically responding to privacy breaches.  A
privacy  breach  protocol  should  include  provisions  for  addressing  all  of  the  actions
outlined  in  this  document.    Having  a  privacy  breach  protocol  in  place  before  an
adverse privacy event occurs is strongly advised; this will yield several benefits:

(cid:1)  Custodians can respond quickly and in a coordinated manner;
(cid:1)  Roles and responsibilities of staff will be understood  beforehand;
(cid:1)  A  process  for  effective  investigations  will  be  documented  and  can  be  set

into motion;

(cid:1)  Effective containment of the breach will be aided;
(cid:1)  Remediation efforts will be easier; and

Regarding notification:

(cid:1)  PHIA does not specify the manner in which notification must be carried out.
However,  for  example,  notification  can  be  by  telephone  or  in  writing,  or
depending on the circumstances, a notation made in the individual’s file to
be discussed at their next appointment;

(cid:1)  There are many factors that may need to be taken into consideration when
deciding  on  the  best  form  of  notification  (e.g.,  the  sensitivity  of  the
personal health information). As a result, the health information custodian
may want to contact the NL OIPC to discuss the most appropriate form of
notification;

(cid:1)  There may also be exceptional circumstances when a custodian may want
to  discuss  notification  with  the  NL  OIPC  before  proceeding;  for  example,
when notification is not reasonably possible or may be detrimental to the
individual.  In  cases  such  as  these,  the  health  information  custodian  is
encouraged  to  contact  the  NL  OIPC  to  discuss  the  circumstances  and
potential approaches to notification;

(cid:1)  When  notifying  individuals  affected  by  the  breach,  custodians  should
provide details of the extent of the breach and the specifics of the personal
health information involved in the breach;

(cid:1)  Custodians should advise affected individuals of the steps that have been
or will be taken to address the breach, both immediate and long-term;
(cid:1)  Custodians  should  advise  affected  individuals that the  NL  OIPC  has  been
contacted  to  ensure  that  all  obligations  under  the  Act  are  fulfilled,  where
applicable (certain circumstances actually require custodians to notify the
NL OIPC about a breach – see section 15(4) of PHIA); and,

(cid:1)  Custodians  should  advise  affected  individuals  that  those  individuals  may
contact  the  NL  OIPC  directly  if  they  are  not  satisfied  with  the  measures
taken by the custodian to respond to the breach.

Custodians  governed  by  PHIA  are  strongly  urged  to  proactively  adopt  measures  to
prevent privacy breaches from occurring.  These measures would normally include:

(cid:1)  Ensuring  that  policies  and  procedures  are  in  place  that  comply  with  the
privacy protection provisions of PHIA and that staff are properly trained in
this respect;

(cid:1)  Safeguarding  personal  health  information  when  it  is  physically  removed
from the office or institution; for example, by ensuring that all laptops and
PDA’s are password protected and data is encrypted;

(cid:1)  Ensuring that a baseline of logging and auditing is in place on all systems,
particularly  those  containing  electronic  health  records  and  that  staff  are
aware that regular audits will occur;

(cid:1)  Conducting a privacy impact assessment (PIA) where appropriate. The PIA
is  a  process  that  helps  determine  whether  new  technologies,  information
systems  and  proposed  programs  or  policies  meet  basic  privacy
requirements  (For  further  assistance  with  PIAs,  see  the  “PHIA  Risk
Management  Toolkit”,  available  on  the  Department  of  Health  and
Community Service’s website at www.gov.nl.ca/health/PHIA);

(cid:1)  When in doubt, obtaining advice from your organization’s legal department

and/or Chief Privacy Officer; and,

(cid:1)  Encouraging a culture of privacy within your organization.

Introduction

The  purpose  of  this  informational  piece  is  to  clarify  the  circumstances  in  which  a
custodian  of  personal  health  information  may  rely  on  implied  consent  for  the
collection,  use  and  disclosure  of  personal  health  information  within  the  “circle  of
care”, and the options available to a custodian where consent cannot be assumed to
be implied.

The  term  “circle  of  care”  is  a  defined  term  in  the  Newfoundland  and  Labrador
Personal Health Information (PHIA).  PHIA defines the circle of care as follows:

…[T]he  expression  "circle  of  care"  means  the  persons  participating  in  and
activities  related  to  the  provision  of  health  care  to  the  individual  who  is  the
subject of the personal health information and includes necessarily incidental
activities such as laboratory work and professional consultation.

Thus,  the  circle  of  care  is  a  term  commonly  used  to  describe  the  ability  of  certain
health  information  custodians  to  assume  an  individual’s  implied  consent  to  collect,
use or disclose personal health information for the purpose of providing health care
to that individual.

A custodian may only deal with an individual’s personal health information within the
circle of care (i.e., may only assume to an individual’s implied consent to collect, use
or disclose personal health information) where all of the following six conditions are
satisfied:

1.1.1.1.  The  custodian  must  fall  within  one  of  the  categories  of  custodians  that  is
authorized  to  rely  upon  implied  consent  (i.e.,  that  can  be  considered  to  be
within the circle of care).

2.2.2.2.  The  personal  health  information  to  be  collected,  used  or  disclosed  by  the
custodian must have been received from the individual, his or her substitute
decision-maker or another health information custodian.

Government of Newfoundland and Labrador

3.3.3.3.  The  health  information  custodian  must  have  received  the  personal  health
information  that  is  being  collected,  used  or  disclosed  for  the  purpose  of
providing or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

4.4.4.4.  The  purpose  of  the  collection,  use  or  disclosure  of  personal  health
information by the health information custodian must be for the provision of
health care or assisting in the provision of health care to the individual.

5.5.5.5.  Regarding disclosure of personal health information within the circle of care,
the disclosure by a custodian must be made for the sole purpose of providing
health care to the individual.

6.6.6.6.  The  implied  consent  of  the  individual  must  be  valid  and  the  individual  must
not have expressly withheld or withdrawn their consent to the collection, use
or disclosure.

(3) a person who operates one of the following:
(3)
(3)(3)

(a)  a health care facility (as defined under PHIA),
(b)  a licensed pharmacy as defined in the Pharmacy Act,
(c)  an ambulance service, or;
(d) a  centre,  program  or  service  for  community  health  or  mental  health,
the primary purpose of which is the provision of health care by a health
care professional or health care provider.

Personal  health  information  is  defined  in  PHIA  as  being  identifying  information
relating to the physical or mental health of an individual, the provision of health care
to an individual, the identification of the substitute decision-maker for the individual
and the payments or eligibility of an individual for health care or coverage for health
care, including the individual’s health number.

A substitute decision-maker is a person authorized under PHIA to consent on behalf
of an individual to the collection, use or disclosure of personal health information.

If  the  personal  health  information  to  be  collected,  used  or  disclosed  was  received
from  a  third  party  –  other  than  the  substitute  decision-maker  for  the  individual  or
another authorized health information custodian (refer to #1, above) – the necessary
consent cannot be assumed to be implied.

Where, for the purpose of providing health care or assisting in the provision of health

the  custodian  is  entitled  to  assume  that  it  has  the  individual's  continuing  implied
consent to use or disclose the information to another custodian or person, but only
for the purpose of providing health care to that individual.  This will be so unless the

has withdrawn their consent (see condition #6, within, for further information).

The concept of the circle of care operates on the basis of a type of consent:  implied
consent.

Implied  consent  can  only  be  presumed  to  exist  where  an  individual  can  be  said  to
have implicitly provided knowledgeable consent.  In order for implied consent to arise
and  to  be  considered  valid,  it  must  be  reasonable  to  believe  that  the  individual  is
aware  of  the  purpose  of  the  collection,  use  or  disclosure  and  knows  that  they  can
either give or withhold consent. It is, in turn, reasonable to believe that an individual
knows  the  purpose  of  the  collection,  use  or  disclosure  if  the  health  information
custodian  posts  or  makes  readily  available  an adequate  notice  generally  describing

Government of Newfoundland and Labrador
Department of Health and Community Services

these purposes in a location where it is likely to come to the individual’s attention or
provides the individual with such a notice.

PHIA  permits  an  individual  to  expressly  withhold  or  withdraw  consent  to  the
collection,  use  or  disclosure  of  his  or  her  personal  health  information,  unless  the
collection, use or disclosure is permitted or required by PHIA to be made without their
consent.    An  individual  may  withdraw  their  consent  for  collections,  uses  or
disclosures that occur within the circle of care; however, custodians may continue to
act on the basis of implied consent until and unless an individual expressly withdraws
their consent.

In most circumstances, if an individual decides to withhold or withdraw consent, PHIA
requires  the  receiving  custodian  to  be  notified  if  the  disclosing  health  information
custodian is prevented from disclosing all of the information that is considered to be
reasonably necessary for the provision of health care.

For  further  information  about  the  ability  of  an  individual  to  expressly  withhold  or
withdraw consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal health information
for health-care purposes, and the obligations on health information custodians in this
context, please refer to G”, “Limited Consent under PHIA”.

Other factors to be considered when relying on implied consent

In addition to the above six conditions, PHIA requires that a custodian not collect, use
or  disclose  personal  health  information  if  other  information  will  serve  the  purpose.
Custodians  are  also  required  to  not  collect,  use  or  disclose  more  personal  health
information  than  is  reasonably  necessary  for  the  intended,  authorized  purpose.
These general limiting principles apply even where a health information custodian is
entitled to rely on an individual’s assumed implied consent.

When  consent  cannot  be  assumed  to  be  implied  (i.e.,  where  any  of  the  above  six
requirements  have  not  been  met),  custodians  should  consider  other  options.
Depending  on the  circumstances,  a  health  information  custodian  may  be  permitted
to  collect,  use  or  disclose  personal  health  information  (a)  without  an  individual’s
consent or (b), with the express consent of that individual.

(a) Without Consent

Health  information  custodians  may  collect,  use  or  disclose  personal  health
information  without  consent  if  the  collection,  use  or  disclosure  is  either
permitted or required by PHIA to be made without consent.

For  example,  under  section  39  of  PHIA,  all  custodians  of  personal  health
information  are  permitted  to  disclose  personal  health  information  without

Government of Newfoundland and Labrador
Department of Health and Community Services

147

consent for (among other purposes) review and planning activities that relate
to the provision of health care by the custodian.

In addition, in certain circumstances set out in section 37 of PHIA, custodians
may  use  or  disclose  personal  health  information  without  consent  where  it  is
reasonably  necessary  for the  provision  of  health  care  and the  individual  has
not expressly instructed otherwise.  This provision would apply, for example, in
emergency  situations  where  the  individual  to  whom  the  information  relates
cannot provide consent of any type, or be presumed to have done so.

Sections 31 and 34 of PHIA, respectively, set out the circumstances in which
personal health information may be collected and used  without consent and
sections  39  -  46  set  out  the  circumstances  in  which  personal  health
information is permitted or required to be disclosed without consent.

(b) With Express Consent

In all other circumstances, health information custodians may only collect, use
or disclose personal health information with the express consent, (i.e., either
verbal  or  written  consent)  of  the  individual  to  whom  the  personal  health
information  relates,  or  their  substitute  decision-maker.    In  order  to  rely  on
express  consent,  health  information  custodians  must  be  satisfied  that  all  of
the required elements of consent are fulfilled.

PHIA governs circumstances involving the collection, use and disclosure of personal
health information.  As such, wherever PHIA addresses issues involving consent, it is
dealing  with  consent  for  the  collection  use  and  disclosure  of  information  –  it  is
important to note that PHIA does not govern matters of consent as they relate to the
provision of treatment or care.  Consent for the provision of treatment or care must
be obtained separately and as per applicable legislative requirements, standards of
practice and / or professional guidelines.

Regardless of whether the consent being obtained is express or implied (i.e., implied,
as in the case of the circle of care), the consent of an individual for the collection, use
or disclosure of personal health information by a custodian:

(cid:1)  Must be the consent of the individual or their substitute decision-maker;
(cid:1)  Must be knowledgeable;
(cid:1)  Must relate to the information that will be collected, used or disclosed; and,
(cid:1)  Must not be obtained through deception or coercion.

In  order  for  consent  to  be  considered  knowledgeable,  it  must  be  reasonable  under
the  circumstances  to  believe  that  the  individual  is  aware  of  the  purpose  of  the
collection, use or disclosure and knows that they can either give or withhold consent.

Introduction

The  Newfoundland  and  Labrador  Personal  Health  Information  Act  (PHIA)  gives
residents  of  the  province  control  over  the  collection,  use  and  disclosure  of  their
personal  health  information  by  requiring  that  custodians  can  only  collect,  use  and
disclose  an  individual’s  personal  health  information  with  the  express  or  (under
certain circumstances) implied consent of that individual, or as otherwise specifically
authorized under the Act.

Integral  to  the  concept  of  consent  is  the  idea  that  individuals  have  the  ability  to
withhold  or  withdraw  their  consent  for  the  collection,  use  or  disclosure  of  their
personal  health  information  for  a  particular  purpose,  including  for  the  provision  of
health care.

Section 23(2) of PHIA makes it clear that individuals may withhold or withdraw their
consent  to  the  collection,  use  or  disclosure  of  their  personal  health  information  by
custodians  where  their  consent  is  required.    Further,  under  certain  circumstances,
individuals may provide express instructions to custodians to not use or disclose their
personal health information without their consent.  These provisions are sometimes
referred to as the “limited consent” provisions under PHIA, though “limited consent”
is not a defined term in the Act.

The  withholding  or  withdrawal  of  consent  or  the  express  instructions  may  take

information.

Although  it  is  up  to  an  individual  to  decide  what  limitations  (if  any)  they  wish  to
impose  in  respect  of  the  collection,  use  or  disclosure  of  their  personal  health
information,  and  to  whom  the  limitation  should  apply,  a  custodian  should  discuss
with the individual how limiting their consent might affect the provision of their health
care, and why a custodian might require access to more personal health information
than the individual has allowed in to provide the best possible care.

Section 23(2) of PHIA makes it clear that an individual may withhold or withdraw their
consent  to  the  collection,  use  or  disclosure  of  their  personal  health  information
where their consent is required.

However, where PHIA specifically authorizes a particular collection, use or disclosure
of personal health information without the consent of an individual (refer to sections
37  and  39  of  PHIA  for  examples),  the  individual  cannot  withdraw  their  consent  for
that  particular  collection,  use  or  disclosure  –  i.e.,  the  individual  cannot  restrict  the
custodian  from  engaging  in  a  collection,  use  or  disclosure  that  PHIA  specifically
authorizes them to engage in without obtaining the individual’s consent.

Additionally, section 27(2) of PHIA makes it clear that an individual cannot prohibit or
restrict  a  recording  of  personal  health  information  by  the  custodian  where  the
recording  is  required  by  law  or  by  established  standards  of  professional  or
institutional  practice.    As  an  example,  such  circumstances  would  include  the
recording  of  demographic  and  care-encounter  information  at  hospitals  and  clinics
during the admission and provision of care to an individual.

Finally,  the  limited  consent  provisions  of  PHIA  do  not  have  retroactive  effect.    This
means that, where an individual validly withholds or withdraws their consent for the
collection, use or disclosure of their personal health information, a custodian will only
have to ensure that they comply with that instruction on an ongoing basis; custodians
will  not  be  required  to  revisit  or  remedy  collections,  uses  or  disclosures  that  were
made under previous valid authority.

Custodians  of  personal  health  information  are  required  to  respect  the  decisions  of
individuals to withhold or withdraw their consent to the collection, use or disclosure
of their personal health information for purposes of providing or assisting in providing
health care, and to respect express instructions not to use or disclose their personal
health information for health care purposes requiring consent.

To ensure that no unauthorized collection, use or disclosure occurs, it is important for
health information custodians to record any express “limited consent” instructions or
directives  upon  obtaining  consent  to  the  collection,  use  or  disclosure  of  personal
health information for health care purposes.  Individuals may also provide, withdraw
or modify “limited consent” directives at any point after they provide consent initially.

Compliance with the “limited consent” provisions of PHIA may be achieved by health
information custodians through:

(cid:1)  policies, procedures or manual processes;
(cid:1)  electronic or technological means;
(cid:1)  a combination of policies, procedures; or,
(cid:1)  manual processes and technological means,

depending  on  the  avenue  chosen  by  the  custodian.    Frequently,  the  proper
implementation  of  “limited  consent”  directives  will  involve  a  combination  of  the
above measures.

Once  an  individual  limits  the  collection,  use  or  disclosure  of  their  personal  health
information by withholding, withdrawing or limiting their consent, a custodian who is
subject to the express instruction cannot collect, use or disclose (as the case may be)
that personal health information for health care purposes unless:

(cid:1)

(cid:1)

the  individual  changes  their  mind  and  informs  the  health  information
custodian accordingly; or

the collection, use or disclosure can be made without the individual’s consent.
(Examples of such circumstances can be found under sections 37 and 39 of
PHIA.)

Introduction

The purpose of this privacy breach incident reporting form is to assist custodians in
notifying  the  Office  of  the  Information  and  Privacy  Commissioner  (OIPC)  of  any
material  breaches  involving  personal  health  information.    Notifying  the  OIPC  may
enhance the public’s understanding of the incident and confidence in the custodian.
Furthermore,  the  OIPC  may  be  able  to  provide  advice  or  guidance  to  custodians
regarding whether to notify affected individuals, as well as other issues relating to the
breach.

Custodians are required under section 15(4) of the Personal Health Information Act
(PHIA)  to  inform  the  OIPC  of  material  breaches.    A  material  breach  includes  an
unauthorized  collection,  use  or  disclosure  of  personal  health  information  as  further
defined  in  the  Regulations.    Although  custodians  are  not  required  to  inform  the
Commissioner  of  breaches  which  do  not  meet  the  definition  of  “material,”  they  are
welcome to do so.

Custodians  should  refer to the  provisions  relating to  a  privacy  breach,  as  set  out  in
section 15 of PHIA, as well as their corresponding policies and procedures in order to
take the correct steps following the occurrence of a breach.

To report a privacy breach to the Commissioner, please fill out this form and send a
printed copy to the OIPC at the address below.  Be sure to complete all sections.  You
may  attach  additional  pages  if  necessary.    Please  indicate  if  a  question  does  not
apply to your situation or if you are not sure how to answer.  Should you need further
assistance in completing this form, or if you have any other questions, please contact
the OIPC.
