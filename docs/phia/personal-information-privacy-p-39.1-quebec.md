APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATION

1.
 The object of this Act is to establish, for the exercise of the rights conferred by articles 35 to 40 of the
Civil  Code  concerning  the  protection  of  personal  information,  particular  rules  with  respect  to  personal
information relating to other persons which a person collects, holds, uses or communicates to third persons in
the course of carrying on an enterprise within the meaning of article 1525 of the Civil Code.

The  Act  applies  to  such  information,  whether  the  enterprise  keeps  the  information  itself  or  through  the
agency of a third person, whatever the nature of its medium and whatever the form in which it is accessible,
whether written, graphic, taped, filmed, computerized, or other.

This Act also applies to personal information held by a professional order to the extent provided for by the
Professional  Code  (chapter  C-26)  and  to  that  held  by  a  political  party,  an  independent  Member  or  an
independent candidate to the extent provided for by the Election Act (chapter E-3.3).

This  Act  does  not  apply  to  journalistic,  historical  or  genealogical  material  collected,  held,  used  or

communicated for the legitimate information of the public.

Divisions II and III of this Act do not apply to personal information which by law is public. Nor do they
apply  to  personal  information  concerning  the  performance  of  duties  within  an  enterprise  by  the  person
concerned,  such  as  the  person’s  name,  title  and  duties,  as  well  as  the  address,  email  address  and  telephone
number of the person’s place of work.

1.1.
 For the purposes of this Act, any person who collects personal information relating to another person
for a serious and legitimate reason is deemed to be establishing a file within the meaning of the Civil Code
and  the  rights  concerning  such  a  file  conferred  by  articles  35  to  40  of  that  Code  apply  to  the  personal
information collected.

 Any person holding personal information on behalf of a person carrying on an enterprise may refer to

16.
the latter every request for access or rectification received from a person to whom such information relates.

Nothing in this section limits a person’s right to obtain, from a personal information agent, access to, or

rectification of, personal information concerning him held by that agent.

1993, c. 17, s. 16.

 Before communicating personal information outside Québec, a person carrying on an enterprise must

17.
conduct a privacy impact assessment. The person must, in particular, take into account

(1)  the sensitivity of the information;

(2)  the purposes for which it is to be used;

(3)  the protection measures, including those that are contractual, that would apply to it; and

(4)

the  legal  framework  applicable  in  the  State  in  which  the  information  would  be  communicated,

including the personal information protection principles applicable in that State.

The  information  may  be  communicated  if  the  assessment  establishes  that  it  would  receive  adequate
protection,  in  particular  in  light  of  generally  recognized  principles  regarding  the  protection  of  personal
information. The communication of the information must be the subject of a written agreement that takes into
account, in particular, the results of the assessment and, if applicable, the terms agreed on to mitigate the risks
identified in the assessment.

The  same  applies  where  the  person  carrying  on  an  enterprise  entrusts  a  person  or  body  outside  Québec

with the task of collecting, using, communicating or keeping such information on his behalf.

This section does not apply to a communication of information under subparagraph 7 of the first paragraph

of section 18.

personal information he holds on that person

  A  person  carrying  on  an  enterprise  may,  without  the  consent  of  the  person  concerned,  communicate

to the Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions if the information is required for the purposes of

the prosecution of an offence under an Act applicable in Québec;

to  a  person  or  body  responsible,  by  law,  for  the  prevention,  detection  or  repression  of  crime  or
statutory  offences  who  requires  it  in  the  performance  of  his  duties,  if  the  information  is  needed  for  the
prosecution of an offence under an Act applicable in Québec;

(4)

to  a  person  to  whom  it  is  necessary  to  communicate  the  information  under  an  Act  applicable  in

Québec or under a collective agreement;

(5)

to a public body within the meaning of the Act respecting Access to documents held by public bodies
and  the  Protection  of  personal  information  (chapter  A-2.1)  which,  through  a  representative,  collects  such
information in the exercise of its functions or the implementation of a program under its management;

to a person or body having the power to compel communication of the information if he or it requires

it in the exercise of his or its duties or functions;

(7)

to a person to whom the information must be communicated by reason of the urgency of a situation

that threatens the life, health or safety of the person concerned;

(7.1)  to a person or body in accordance with sections 18.1 to 18.4;

(8)

to a person who may use the information for study, research or statistical purposes in accordance with

section 21 or a person authorized pursuant to section 21.1;

(9)

to a person who is authorized by law to recover debts on behalf of others and who requires it for that

purpose in the performance of his duties;

(9.1)  to a person if the information is needed for the recovery of a claim of the enterprise;

(10)  (subparagraph repealed).

A person carrying on an enterprise must make an entry of every communication made under subparagraphs

6 to 9.1 of the first paragraph.

The persons referred to in subparagraphs 1, 9 and 9.1 of the first paragraph who receive communication of
information  may  communicate  the  information  to  the  extent  that  such  communication  is  necessary,  in  the
performance  of  their  duties,  to  achieve  the  purposes  for  which  they  received  communication  of  the
information.

The  holder  of  a  security  guard  agency  licence  or  investigation  agency  licence  issued  under  the  Private
Security Act (chapter S-3.5) or a body having as its object the prevention, detection or repression of crime or
statutory offences and a person carrying on an enterprise may, without the consent of the person concerned,
communicate  among  themselves  the  information  needed  for  conducting  an  inquiry  for  the  purpose  of
preventing, detecting or repressing a crime or a statutory offence. The same applies in respect of information
communicated  among  persons  carrying  on  an  enterprise,  if  the  person  who  communicates  or  collects  such
information  has  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  that  the  person  concerned  has  committed,  or  is  about  to
commit, a crime or statutory offence against one or other of the persons carrying on an enterprise.

  In  addition  to  the  cases  referred  to  in  section  18,  a  person  who  carries  on  an  enterprise  may  also
communicate  personal  information  the  person  holds  on  another  person,  without  the  consent  of  the  persons
concerned, in order to protect a person or an identifiable group of persons where there is reasonable cause to
believe that a serious risk of death or of serious bodily injury, related in particular to a disappearance or to an
act of violence, including a suicide attempt, threatens the person or group and where the nature of the threat
generates a sense of urgency.

The  information  may  in  such  case  be  communicated  to  any  person  exposed  to  the  risk  or  that  person’s

representative, and to any person who can come to that person’s aid.

A  person  carrying  on  an  enterprise  who  communicates  information  pursuant  to  this  section  may  only
communicate  such  information  as  is  necessary  to  achieve  the  purposes  for  which  the  information  is
communicated.

Where  information  is  so  communicated  by  a  person  carrying  on  an  enterprise,  the  person  must  make  an

entry of the communication.

PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

No proceedings may be brought against a person carrying on an enterprise for communicating information
in good faith under this section. The same applies to any person who, on behalf of the person carrying on an
enterprise, participates in good faith in such a communication, even indirectly.

For the purposes of the first paragraph, “serious bodily injury” means any physical or psychological injury
that  is  significantly  detrimental  to  the  physical  integrity  or  the  health  or  well-being  of  a  person  or  an
identifiable group of persons.

 A person carrying on an enterprise may, without the consent of the person concerned, communicate
personal  information  concerning  another  person  to  an  archival  agency  if  the  archival  agency  is  a  person
carrying on an enterprise whose object is the acquisition, preservation and distribution of documents for their
general informational value and if the information is communicated as part of the transfer or deposit of the
archives of the enterprise.

A person carrying on an enterprise may also communicate personal information to any person without the
consent of the person concerned if the document containing the information is more than 100 years old or if
more than 30 years have elapsed since the death of the person concerned. However, no information relating to
a person’s health may be communicated without the consent of the person concerned unless 100 years have
elapsed since the date of the document.

Notwithstanding  the  first  and  second  paragraphs,  the  information  may  be  communicated  for  research
purposes, without the consent of the person concerned, before the time specified has elapsed if the documents
containing  the  information  are  not  structured  so  as  to  allow  retrieval  by  reference  to  a  person’s  name  or
identifying code or symbol and the information cannot be retrieved by means of such a reference. The person
to  whom  the  information  is  communicated  must  preserve  the  confidentiality  of  the  personal  information
throughout the period during which it may not be communicated without the consent of the person concerned.

 A person carrying on an enterprise may, without the consent of the person concerned, communicate
personal  information  to  any  person  or  body  if  the  information  is  necessary  for  carrying  out  a  mandate  or
performing a contract of enterprise or for services entrusted to that person or body by the person carrying on
an enterprise.

In such a case, the person carrying on an enterprise must

(1)  entrust the mandate or contract in writing; and

(2)  specify in the mandate or contract the measures the mandatary or the person performing the contract
must  take  to  protect  the  confidentiality  of  the  personal  information  communicated,  to  ensure  that  the
information  is  used  only  for  carrying  out  the  mandate  or  performing  the  contract  and  to  ensure  that  the
mandatary or person does not keep the information after the expiry of the mandate or contract. A person or
body  carrying  out  a  mandate  or  performing  a  contract  of  enterprise  or  for  services  referred  to  in  the  first
paragraph  must  notify  the  person  in  charge  of  the  protection  of  personal  information  without  delay  of  any
violation  or  attempted  violation  by  any  person  of  any  obligation  concerning  the  confidentiality  of  the
information  communicated,  and  must  also  allow  the  person  in  charge  of  the  protection  of  personal
information to conduct any verification relating to confidentiality requirements.

Subparagraph  2  of  the  second  paragraph  does  not  apply  if  the  mandatary  or  the  person  performing  the
contract is a public body within the meaning of the Act respecting Access to documents held by public bodies
and the Protection of personal information (chapter A-2.1) or a member of a professional order.

PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

18.4.
  Where  the  communication  of  personal  information  is  necessary  for  concluding  a  commercial
transaction to which a  person carrying on an enterprise intends to be a party, the person may communicate
such information, without the consent of the person concerned, to the other party to the transaction.

An agreement must first be entered into with the other party that stipulates, among other things, that the

latter undertakes

(1)  to use the information only for concluding the commercial transaction;

(2)  not to communicate the information without the consent of the person concerned, unless authorized to

do so by this Act;

(3)  to take the measures required to protect the confidentiality of the information; and

(4)  to destroy the information if the commercial transaction is not concluded or if using the information is

no longer necessary for concluding the commercial transaction.

Where  the  commercial  transaction  has  been  concluded  and  the  other  party  wishes  to  continue  using  the
information  or  to  communicate  it,  that  party  may  use  or  communicate  it  only  in  accordance  with  this  Act.
Within  a  reasonable  time  after  the  commercial  transaction  is  concluded,  that  party  must  notify  the  person
concerned that it now holds personal information concerning him because of the transaction.

For the purposes of this section, “commercial transaction” means the alienation or leasing of all or part of
an enterprise or of its assets, a modification of its legal structure by merger or otherwise, the obtaining of a
loan or any other form of financing by the enterprise or of a security taken to guarantee any of its obligations.

 Every person carrying on an enterprise having as its object entering into a credit contract, a long-term
1
contract of lease of goods or a contract involving sequential performance for a service provided at a distance,
,
who consults credit reports or recommendations as to the solvency of natural persons prepared by a personal
c
information  agent,  must  inform  such  persons  of  their  right  of  access  and  rectification  in  relation  to  the
.
personal information held by the agent and indicate to them the manner in which and the place where they
2
may have access to the reports or recommendations and cause them to be rectified, where necessary.
5

The person carrying on such an enterprise must communicate to a natural person, on request, the content of
any credit report or recommendation he has consulted for the purpose of making a decision concerning the
person. The person must also inform the natural person who so requests that

(1)

the refusal to enter into a contract referred to in the first paragraph or the entering into such a contract

with less advantageous conditions for the natural person, or

(2)

the refusal to increase the credit extended under a credit contract or the increasing of the credit with

less advantageous conditions for the natural person

is based on the consultation of such a report or recommendation.

For the purposes of this section:

(1)  credit  that  is  the  subject  of  a  contract  has  the  meaning  assigned  by  subparagraph  f  of  the  first

paragraph of section 1 of the Consumer Protection Act (chapter P-40.1);

(2)  long-term contract of lease of goods has the meaning assigned by section 150.2 of that Act; and

  Every  person  who  consults  a  recommendation  or  credit  report  referred  to  in  section  19  or  other
document sent by a credit assessment agent on which the notice referred to in the first paragraph of section 10
of the Credit Assessment Agents Act (chapter A-8.2) appears or is otherwise notified by that agent must take
reasonable  measures  to  ensure  that  the  person  from  whom  consent  was  obtained  to  obtain  the
recommendation, report, document or personal information concerning him is actually the person who is the
subject of the recommendation, report, document or personal information, the representative of that person or
the person having parental authority over that person before entering into a contract with that person.

ACCESS BY PERSONS CONCERNED

§ 1. — General provisions

27.
 Every person carrying on an enterprise who holds personal information on another person must, at the
request  of  the  person  concerned,  confirm  the  existence  of  the  personal  information,  communicate  it  to  the
person and allow him to obtain a copy of it.

At  the  applicant’s  request,  computerized  personal  information  must  be  communicated  in  the  form  of  a

written and intelligible transcript.

Unless doing so raises serious practical difficulties, computerized personal information collected from the
applicant,  and  not  created  or  inferred  using  personal  information  concerning  him,  must,  at  his  request,  be
communicated  to  him  in  a  structured,  commonly  used  technological  format.  The  information  must  also  be
communicated, at the applicant’s request, to any person or body authorized by law to collect such information.

If the person concerned is handicapped, reasonable accommodation must be provided on request to enable

the person to exercise the right of access provided for in this division.

28.
 In addition to the rights provided under the first paragraph of article 40 of the Civil Code, any person
may,  if  personal  information  concerning  him  is  inaccurate,  incomplete  or  equivocal,  or  if  collecting,
communicating or keeping it are not authorized by law, require that the information be rectified.

PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

In  assessing  the  criteria  set  out  in  the  second  paragraph,  the  following,  in  particular,  must  be  taken  into

account:

(1)  the fact that the person concerned is a public figure;

(2)  the fact that the information concerns the person at the time the person is a minor;

(3)  the fact that the information is up to date and accurate;

(4)  the sensitivity of the information;

(5)  the context in which the information is disseminated;

(6)

the  time  elapsed  between  the  dissemination  of  the  information  and  the  request  made  under  this

section; and

(7)  where  the  information  concerns  a  criminal  or  penal  procedure,  the  obtaining  of  a  pardon  or  the

application of a restriction on the accessibility of records of the courts of justice.

Sections 30, 32 and 34 apply, with the necessary modifications, to a request made under this section. When
granting  such  a  request,  the  person  in  charge  of  the  protection  of  personal  information  shall  attest,  in  his
written reply under section 32, to the cessation of the dissemination of the personal information or to the de-
indexation or the re-indexation of the hyperlink.

Any person carrying on an enterprise who intends to require a charge under this section must inform the
applicant, in advance, of the approximate amount that will be charged for the transcription, reproduction or
transmission of information.

34.
 The person in charge of the protection of personal information must give the reasons for any refusal to
grant a request and indicate the provision of law on which the refusal is based, the remedies available to the

 Where the person in charge of the protection of personal information grants a request for rectification,
he must, in addition to the obligations prescribed in the second paragraph of article 40 of the Civil Code, issue
free of charge to the person who made the request a copy of any personal information modified or added or, as
the case may be, an attestation of the deletion of personal information.

  Any  interested  person  may  submit  an  application  to  the  Commission  d’accès  à  l’information  for  the
examination of a disagreement relating to the application of a legislative provision concerning access to or the
rectification of personal information, or concerning the application of section 28.1.

43.
 Where the disagreement results from a refusal to grant a request or from a failure to respond within the
time  limit  prescribed  by  law,  the  person  concerned  disposes  of  a  period  of  30  days  from  the  refusal  or  the
expiry of the time limit to submit the disagreement to the Commission unless the Commission, for reasonable
cause, releases the person concerned from failure to submit the disagreement within that time.

  A  person  carrying  on  an  enterprise  who  holds  personal  information  on  others  may  request
authorization from the Commission to disregard applications that are obviously improper by reason of their
number or their repetitious or systematic nature or applications that, in the opinion of the Commission, are not
consistent with the object of this Act. The person may also request the Commission to limit the scope of the
applicant’s request or extend the time limit within which he must reply.

would be applicable to the processing of a request under section 32, from the date the applicant’s most recent
