The Health Information Act and the regulations made under it establish the rules that must be

followed for the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health information in the health
sector. The Health Information Act Guidelines and Practices Manual is designed as a reference

tool to help custodians and affiliates apply and administer the Act.

The Manual is intended to explain the legislation and to offer guidance on approaches,

procedures and best practices. The information contained in the Manual is not meant to present

binding rules. Any examples used are illustrative only and should not be used as authority for any
decisions made under the Act.

The chapters of the Manual generally follow the scheme and order of the Act. A few chapters

have been added to cover administrative processes and the first chapter is an overall introduction
to the Act. At the back of many of the chapters are ‘Things to Remember’. These pages include

bullet summaries of the important things to remember in the preceding chapter and, in some

cases, decision flow charts or tables. They are meant to be used by readers as quick reminders
or checklists about a particular topic but are not meant as a substitute for the more
comprehensive chapter content or for referring to the Act and the regulations.

The Act and regulations can be found at: http://www.qp.alberta.ca/

There are a number of Appendices at the back of the Manual. These include forms, model letters,

a detailed implementation checklist and components for agreements under the Act.

Best practices and examples used in the Manual should be considered as guidelines only. They

are in boxes accompanying the text.

References to Practice Notes from the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner

(OIPC) should also be considered as guidelines only since they are based upon practices related
to the Health Information Act (HIA), the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy (FOIP)
Act and the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA).

Orders from the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner (OIPC) are binding on the
parties to reviews and investigations related to the Health Information Act, the FOIP Act and

PIPA.

Health Information Act, FOIP Act and PIPA Orders are distinguished by their numbering in the

Commissioner’s Office. HIA Orders are identified with the letter H (i.e., H2002-001), FOIP Orders

are identified with the letter F (i.e., F2002-001) and PIPA Orders are identified with the letter P
(i.e., P2006-001).

Chapter 14

Duty to Notify

14.1 Overview of Chapter Fourteen

This Chapter will cover:

•
the duties of custodians and affiliates to notify;
•  what a loss, unauthorized access or disclosure is;
•  what to do if your organization experiences a loss, or unauthorized access or disclosure;
•  how to assess whether there is a risk of harm to an individual;
•  how to notify the Minister, Commissioner, and affected individual(s);
•  how to prevent a future loss, unauthorized access or disclosure; and
•

the offence provisions relevant to the duty to notify and failing to safeguard information.

14.2 Introduction to the Duty to Notify

In June 2014, the Health Information Act was amended to require a custodian to as soon as

practicable give notice in accordance with the regulations of a loss of or any unauthorized access

to, or disclosure of individually identifying health information in the custody or control of the

custodian if there is a risk of harm to an individual as a result of the loss or unauthorized access
or disclosure.

Notice is to be given to the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta, the Minister of
Health, and the affected individual(s). The requirements for the form and content of these notices
are set out in section 8.2 of the Health Information Regulation.

The amendments also require an affiliate of a custodian who becomes aware of any loss or any

unauthorized access to or disclosure of individually identifying health information in the custody or

control of the custodian to as soon as practicable notify the custodian in accordance with the
regulations.

“As soon as practicable”, in the context of section 60.1 of the Health Information Act, means
as soon as the affiliate or custodian becomes aware of the loss, unauthorized access or

disclosure, and has the information that is necessary to properly execute the notice.

Custodians and affiliates are subject to offence penalties for failure to meet their duty to notify.

Custodians are also subject to an offence provision for failure to take reasonable steps in

8

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

accordance with the regulation to maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards that

will protect against any reasonably anticipated threat or hazard to the security or integrity of
health information and against any loss of health information.

Where notification is not required under the Health Information Act, a custodian or affiliate may
still be required to notify under contractual agreements or other privacy laws.

14.3 When is Notification Required?

Section 60.1 of the Health Information Act requires notification to the Commissioner, Minister
and affected individual(s) where:

a)

b)

there has been any loss of, or any unauthorized access to or disclosure of
individually identifying health information; and
there is a risk of harm to the individual who is the subject of the information as a result of

the loss or unauthorized access or disclosure.

An access or disclosure is “unauthorized” if it occurs in contravention of the Health Information

Act or its regulations.

Please note that the scenarios below are examples to illustrate where a loss, unauthorized

access or disclosure has occurred. The scenarios do not include an assessment of risk of harm to

determine if notification is required.

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

What is a Loss?

A loss occurs where information, which was once in the custody or under the control of a
custodian, is no longer in the custody or under the control of that custodian. Note that this does
not include where a custodian ceases to have custody or control of records due to a legitimate
disclosure of the records to a successor custodian under section 35(1)(q) of the Health
Information Act. A loss may involve physical or electronic records. Examples of loss may include
where a medical record is lost by a storage facility contracted by a custodian, or where server
data becomes corrupted, resulting in a loss of digital files.

Loss Scenario A – Theft of Files: A physician at a Calgary hospital took home a paper
copy of medical files for 25 of her patients. The physician’s home was broken into and the
locked briefcase where the files were kept was stolen.

Loss Scenario B – Lost Laptop: In the course of an information technology project, a
technician working for a custodian took home a laptop containing unencrypted individually

identifying health information of about 200 patients. This laptop was accidentally left in a taxi
and could not be retrieved.

Loss Scenario C – Loss of Files: A dental practice has an accidental fire in which all
medical records are destroyed.

What is an Unauthorized Access?

An unauthorized access occurs where an individual accesses information that they were not
authorized to access. Examples of unauthorized access may include where an electronic record

is accessed in error by a health service provider, an individual deliberately accesses a record
they are not authorized to access, or where an individual without the authority to access health

information inappropriately accesses a filing cabinet containing individually identifying health
information.

10

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

Unauthorized Access Scenario A – Access for Personal Use: A nurse working in an
Edmonton hospital has an acquaintance in the hospital who has just given birth. For curiosity’s
sake, the nurse accesses the record of his acquaintance.

Unauthorized Access Scenario B – Hacking: An individual hacked into a hospital’s
computer network and the hospital’s IT staff have determined that he accessed diagnostic,
treatment and care information of multiple patients in the hospital.

Unauthorized Access Scenario C – Access in Error: In the course of providing
treatment to a patient, a physician attempts to access the patient’s electronic health record to
obtain the patient’s lab results. In error, the physician accesses the information of a different
person with a similar name, who has never been the physician’s patient.

What is an Unauthorized Disclosure

An unauthorized disclosure occurs where there has been a deliberate or accidental disclosure
of individually identifying health information in contravention of the Health Information Act.

Examples of unauthorized disclosure include where a fax is received by an individual who is not
the intended recipient, or where a disclosure that can only be authorized with valid consent is

made outside the terms of that consent.

Unauthorized Disclosure Scenario A – Incorrectly Addressed Letter: A letter
regarding an Albertan’s cancer screening was sent to the Albertan’s former address and the
letter was opened by another person who now resides at that address.

Unauthorized Disclosure Scenario B – Improper Disposal: A contractor assigned by
a clinic to shred patients’ medical records instead dumped the records in a landfill, where they
were found by a waste disposal employee.

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

11

Unauthorized Disclosure Scenario D – Incomplete Destruction of Information: A medical
clinic’s shredding machine broke mid-way through the shredding of papers containing individual

identifying health information. The medical office throws the partially shredded documents in the

dumpster, where they are seen by a waste disposal employee.

Unauthorized Disclosure Scenario C – Disclosure Outside of Consent: An individual’s
employer required proof of the employee’s hospital stay in order to accept the claim of time off.

The individual provided consent for the hospital to disclose the duration of her stay to her
employer. Instead of just providing the duration of stay, the hospital disclosed the individual’s

discharge summary, which included diagnostic, treatment and care information, to the employer.

Disclosure of Non-Identifying Information

If the identity of the individual who is the subject of the information cannot be readily ascertained
from the information, then the information is considered non-identifying. The Health Information

Act authorizes the collection, use and disclosure of non-identifying information for any purpose.
As such, any use or disclosure of non-identifying information is authorized under the Health
Information Act. For more information, see sections 5.2.1, 7.2.1, 7.3, 8.2, 8.2.1 of the HIA
Guidelines and Practices Manual.

14.4 Affiliates Duty to Notify

Section 60.1(1) of the Health Information Act requires an affiliate of a custodian who becomes
aware of any loss of individually identifying health information or any unauthorized access to or

disclosure of individually identifying health information in the custody or control of the custodian to
as soon as practicable notify the custodian in accordance with the regulations.

Form and Manner of the Notification

The custodian must establish policies and procedures to direct their affiliates as to how this duty
is to be carried out. For example, the custodian may wish to be notified through a telephone call,

an email, a submitted form, or another method.

If the custodian has established requirements regarding the form and content of this notice,
section 8.2(1)(a) of the Health Information Regulation requires the affiliate to execute the
notice in accordance with the custodian’s requirements.

12

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

If the custodian has not established requirements regarding the form and content of this notice,
section 8.2(1)(b) of the Health Information Regulation requires the notice to be in writing and
include:

1.  A description of the circumstances of the loss or unauthorized access or disclosure;
2.  The date on which or period of time within which the loss or unauthorized access or

disclosure occurred;

3.  The date on which the loss or unauthorized access or disclosure was discovered; and

4.  A description of the information that was lost or that was the subject of the unauthorized

access or disclosure.

Accountability

Regardless of the chosen notification method, as a best practice, the custodian and affiliate

should have in place a record of this notification so compliance with the Act can be proven.

14.5 Custodian’s Duty to Notify

Subsections 60.1(2) and (3) of the Health Information Act require a custodian to notify the
Commissioner, Minister and individual who is the subject of the information of any loss of,

unauthorized access to, or disclosure of individually identifying health information in the custody
or control of the custodian if there is a risk of harm to the individual who is the subject of the

information as a result of the loss or unauthorized access or disclosure.

Assess Risk of Harm

Where a custodian becomes aware of any loss of, unauthorized access to, or disclosure of
individually identifying health information in their custody or control (whether they discovered it
themselves or were notified of it by an affiliate under section 60.1(1) of the Health Information
Act), they must assess whether there is a risk of harm to the individual who is the subject of the
information as a result of the loss or unauthorized access or disclosure.

Notification

Where the custodian determines a risk of harm exists, they must, as soon as practicable, give

notice in accordance with the regulations.

If the custodian is not sure if any loss of, unauthorized access to, or disclosure of individually

identifying health information in their custody or control has occurred, a custodian should continue

to investigate the situation to determine if a loss or unauthorized access or disclosure has

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

13

occurred. If the custodian cannot be certain that a loss or unauthorized access or disclosure has

occurred, they are not required to notify, but may consider notifying if they deem it necessary.

14.6 Assessing Risk of Harm

Where a custodian becomes aware of a loss or unauthorized access or disclosure, the custodian
is required to assess whether there is a risk of harm to the individual who is the subject of the

information as a result of the loss or unauthorized access or disclosure. If a risk of harm is
determined to exist, section 60.1(2) of the Health Information Act requires the custodian to
undertake notification.

14.6.1 Factors to Consider

Section 8.1(1) of the Health Information Regulation sets out the factors that a custodian must
consider when assessing risk of harm. A custodian is required to consider the following factors in
addition to any other relevant factors:

i.

ii.

whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the information has been or may be
accessed by or disclosed to a person;

whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the information has been misused or
will be misused;

iii.

whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the information could be used for the

iv.

v.

vi.

purpose of identity theft or to commit fraud;
whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the information is of a type that could

cause embarrassment or physical, mental or financial harm to or damage the reputation
of the individual who is the subject of the information;

whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the loss of or unauthorized access to
or disclosure of the information has adversely affected or will adversely affect the

provision of a health service to the individual who is the subject of the information;

in the case of electronic information, whether the custodian is able to demonstrate that
the information was encrypted or otherwise secured in a manner that would

i.

ii.

prevent the information from being accessed by a person who is not authorized
to access the information, or

render the information unintelligible by a person who is not authorized to access
the information;

vii.

in the case of a loss of information, whether the custodian is able to demonstrate that the

information was lost in circumstances in which the information was

i.

ii.

destroyed, or

rendered inaccessible or unintelligible;

14

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

viii.

in the case of a loss of information that is subsequently recovered by the custodian,

whether the custodian can demonstrate that the information was not accessed before it
was recovered;

ix.

in the case of an unauthorized access to or disclosure of information, whether the
custodian is able to demonstrate that the only person who accessed the information or to

whom the information was disclosed
is a custodian or an affiliate,

i.

ii.

is subject to confidentiality policies and procedures that meet the requirements of

section 60 of the Act,
accessed the information in a manner that is in accordance with the person’s

duties as a custodian or affiliate and not for an improper purpose, and
did not use or disclose the information except in determining that the information

iii.

iv.

was accessed by or disclosed to the person in error and in taking any steps
reasonably necessary to address the unauthorized access or disclosure.

If a custodian is able to demonstrate that a circumstance set out in section 8.1(1)(f) to (i) applies

in the case of the loss or unauthorized access or disclosure, the custodian is not required to give
notice under section 60.1(2) of the Act.

The Risk of Harm Checklist in Appendix 3 can be used to assist custodians in ensuring that
they have considered all required factors under section 8.1(1) of the Health Information
Regulation.

Reasonable Basis

A reasonable basis exists where a custodian can, based on their professional judgement,
understanding of the incident or other relevant information such as recommendations from

privacy, security, and legal teams, commit to a decision that the factor is applicable in the
situation.

The Factors in Detail

Part A: Circumstances where notification is required:

8.1(1)(a) Whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the information has been or may be
accessed by or disclosed to a person;

•  This factor addresses whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the information
actually has been accessed or will likely be accessed based on the level of security
protecting the information. This does not include where information has been transmitted in

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

15

an insecure fashion (e.g. non-encrypted email) but there is no likelihood that the information

will be accessed by an unintended recipient.

•  For example, where the custodian can identify from an audit of the access logs of their

electronic medical record that an affiliate has accessed information they were not authorized

to access.

•

If due to a technical error, a custodian unintentionally makes an individual’s health
information publicly available on their website, the custodian would need to consider that the

health information has been disclosed to a person.

•  Some factors that a custodian should consider when making this assessment include:

•

In the case of a loss or disclosure of information, was the information in a form that would be

accessible to anyone who discovered or received the information?

-  Can the custodian remotely destroy the information to prevent it from being accessed?

8.1(1)(b) Whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the information has been misused or
will be misused;

•  This factor addresses a person’s intent or information about how the information has been or

may be used. For example, where the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure was

intentional, this factor applies. Where the incident was not intentional, but was inadvertently
disclosed to a person who may have malicious intent, this factor applies. In situations where

the intent is unknown, if there is evidence of misuse or potential misuse this factor applies.

Even if there is no malicious intent, this factor will still apply if there is a reasonable basis to
believe that the information has or will be misused.

•  For example, where the custodian is aware that the individual who accessed or received the
information intends to use it to embarrass the individual who is the subject of the information.

Even if the individual who accessed or received the information does not intend to use it to
embarrass the individual but might nonetheless inadvertently do so, this factor would still

apply.

•  Some factors that a custodian should consider when making this assessment include:

-  Does the individual who accessed or received the information have a personal

relationship with the individual who is the subject of the information?

-  Does the individual who accessed or received the information have a malicious intent?

-  How did the individual who accessed the information use the information?

-

In the case of a loss or disclosure of information, was the information in a form that would

be accessible to anyone who discovered or received the information?

16

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

8.1(1)(c) Whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the information could be used for the
purpose of identity theft or to commit fraud;

•  This factor addresses the type of information involved in the incident and its ability to be used

for fraudulent purposes or to commit identity theft.

•  For example, where the custodian is aware that the information that has been lost contains
registration information such as contact information, personal health numbers or credit card

information.

•  Some factors that a custodian should consider when making this assessment include:

-

Is the information of a type that could be used for identity theft or fraud?

8.1(1)(d) Whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the information is of a type that
could cause embarrassment or physical, mental or financial harm to or damage the reputation of

the individual who is the subject of the information;

•  This factor addresses the nature and sensitivity of the information in relation to the individual.

•  For example, information that includes specific information about an individual’s physical or

mental health, such as lab results or diagnoses, or information that could be used to track the
individual or their financial information, such as contact information or credit card information.

•  For example, the lost record is from a health facility within a correctional facility, thus

identifying the individual as an inmate.

•  Note that a custodian should consider the individual who is the subject of the information as

well as the type of information involved when making this assessment.

-  For example, consider the individual’s current and past emotional and mental health.
Also, the type of information involved is important. For example, if the information

involved is an appointment reminder the chance of harm or damage may be less
compared to if the information involved is an individual’s test results. Consider whether

the individual would be concerned with the release of this information.

8.1(1)(e) Whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that the loss of or unauthorized access to
or disclosure of the information has adversely affected or will adversely affect the provision of a

health service to the individual who is the subject of the information;

This factor addresses the impact of the breach on the provision of health services.

•  For example, where an emergency room patient’s diagnosis depends on the results of a lab

test and the lab results are faxed to the wrong fax number. This could result in the delay of

the diagnosis, thereby having an adverse impact on treatment.

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

17

•  Some factors that a custodian should consider when making this assessment include:

-  Has the loss, access, or disclosure resulted in a delay or prevented a health service from

being provided to the individual?

-

Is the information necessary for an urgently needed health service to the individual who is

the subject of the information?

-  Was the loss, access, or disclosure discovered in a reasonable amount of time to allow

for any adverse impact on the provision of a health service to be mitigated?

In addition to considering the factors in sections 8.1(1)(a)-(e), if there are any other factors that
are relevant which may indicate risk of harm to the individual, those factors should also be

considered.

•  Some factors that a custodian should consider when making this assessment include:

-

Is the custodian aware of any circumstances, not included in these factors, which would
indicate a risk of harm to the individual who is the subject of the information?

-  How many individuals were affected by the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure?

-  Whether there is reasonable basis to believe that the individual whose information was
lost, accessed, or disclosed without authorization is especially sensitive to any possible

breaches of their privacy (for example, if their Netcare account is masked and suffered an
unauthorized access).

Part B: Circumstances where notification is not required:

Where any of the above factors apply to a loss, unauthorized access or disclosure of individually

health information, the risk of harm may be sufficiently mitigated by the circumstances found

below. If the factors below apply, the custodian is not required to give notice under section
60.1(2) of the Health Information Act:

8.1(1)(f) In the case of electronic information, whether the custodian is able to demonstrate that
the information was encrypted or otherwise secured in a manner that would;

i.

prevent the information from being accessed by a person who is not authorized to access
the information, or

ii.

render the information unintelligible by a person who is not authorized to access the

information.

•  For example, notification would likely not be required:

18

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

-  where an email containing individually identifying health information is sent to the wrong

email address, but the email was properly encrypted and therefore cannot be accessed
by the recipient; or

-  where a laptop or other device is lost, but is properly encrypted and password protected,

and therefore cannot be accessed by an individual who finds the laptop or device.

•  Some factors that a custodian should consider when making this assessment include:

-  Was the information secured in accordance with industry standards?

-  Has the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure put the information in the hands of an
individual or group that could have the capability to bypass the information security?

-

In the case of a loss or disclosure of information, was the information in a form that would
be accessible to anyone who discovered or received the information?

8.1(1)(g) In the case of a loss of information, whether the custodian is able to demonstrate that
the information was lost in circumstances in which the information was

ii.

destroyed, or

rendered inaccessible or unintelligible;

•  For example, notification would likely not be required:

-  where information was lost in a fire or flood; or

-  where medical slides are broken as they fall out of a truck.

•  Some factors that a custodian should consider when making this assessment include:

-  As a result of the loss, was the information completely destroyed?

8.1(1)(h) In the case of a loss of information that is subsequently recovered by the custodian,
whether the custodian can demonstrate that the information was not accessed before it was

recovered;

•  For example, where a locked briefcase is left in a public place, but is then recovered and it is

clear that the briefcase has not been opened.

•  Some factors that a custodian should consider when making this assessment include:

-  Was the information retrieved?

-

Is there evidence that the information was accessed?

-  Was the information in a form that was easily accessible?

•  Section 63 of the Health Information Act requires custodians to implement policies that
facilitate the implementation of the Act within their organization. Section 60 of the Health
Information Act requires custodians to implement reasonable safeguards to protect the
confidentiality and integrity of health information and the privacy of the individuals who are
the subjects of that information. As such, a custodian must have in place a policy or policies
that address the requirements of section 60 of the Health Information Act. These policies
would prohibit the receiving custodian from further disclosing the information in contravention
of the Health Information Act.

•  Some factors that a custodian should consider when making this assessment include:

-

Is the individual who received the information or accessed the information a custodian or

affiliate?

-  Does the custodian or affiliate have policies and procedures in place regarding the

adequate protection of health information?

-

Is the custodian or affiliate bound by a confidentiality oath?

iii.

accessed the information in a manner that is in accordance with the person’s duties as a

custodian or affiliate and not for an improper purpose, and

•  Some factors that a custodian should consider when making this assessment include:

-  Was the custodian or affiliate accessing the information in an attempt to provide a health

service to the individual who is the subject of the information or to another individual?

-  Was the custodian or affiliate authorized to have access to the information or the system

containing the information?

-  Did the custodian or affiliate use another individual’s access credentials to gain access to

the information?

-  Did the custodian or affiliate access the information deliberately for an unauthorized

purpose?

-  Did the custodian or affiliate who accessed the record do so for personal reasons?

20

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

-  Did the custodian or affiliate who received the disclosure have a personal relationship

with the individual who was the subject of the information?

iv.

did not use or disclose the information except in determining that the information was

accessed by or disclosed to the person in error and in taking any steps reasonably
necessary to address the unauthorized access or disclosure.

•  Note that this is a two-part factor: a custodian or affiliate is permitted under section 27(1)(g)
of the Health Information Act to collect, use or disclose individually identifying health
information for internal management purposes. As such, where a custodian or affiliate views
health information that has been disclosed to them, realizes that it was disclosed to them in

error and uses that information (such as health services provider contact information) to
report the breach to the custodian or affiliate who disclosed the information, they meet both
parts of section 8.1(1)(i)(iv).

•  Some factors that a custodian should consider when making this assessment include:

-  Did the custodian or affiliate who received the fax (an unauthorized disclosure) use the

information beyond determining that the fax was not intended for them?

-  Did the custodian or affiliate who received the fax disclose the information to another

person who was not the sender of the fax?

-  Did the custodian or affiliate who received or accessed the record use or disclose the

information for another purpose other than determining that the record was accessed or
disclosed in error or in mitigating the access?

In addition to considering the factors in sections 8.1(1)(f)-(i), if the custodian is aware of any other
factor that is relevant to the potential mitigation of the risk, that factor should also be considered.

•  For example, where the custodian can confirm that the individual who received the

unauthorized disclosure has destroyed the information and did not retain any copies.

•  Some factors that a custodian should consider when making this assessment include:

-

Is the custodian aware of any reason, not included in these factors, which would indicate

that the risk has been appropriately mitigated?

-  Can the custodian confirm that the information was properly destroyed by the individual

who received or found the information?

-  Can the custodian confirm that the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure was

unintentional?

Where a custodian is able to demonstrate that factors from Part B are present, the factors from
Part A may be appropriately mitigated and therefore notification is not required. In some

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

21

circumstances, the custodian may decide that notification is necessary even when factors from

Part B are present.

Things to Consider

Where the loss, unauthorized access to, or disclosure of individually identifying health information

in the custody or control of a custodian has or will impact upon the provision of health services, or
is deliberate, notification should be strongly considered. In addition, where the individual who
accesses or receives the information is not a custodian or affiliate under the Health Information
Act, notification should be strongly considered.

14.6.2 Examples of Risk Assessment

The following fictional scenarios present examples of applying the factors set out in section
8.1(1) of the Health Information Regulation that a custodian must consider when assessing
risk of harm. In each scenario, a loss, unauthorized access or disclosure of individually identifying
health information has occurred and the custodian must now apply the factors to assess whether

there is a risk of harm to the individual who is the subject of the information as a result of the
incident. Each of the factors from Part A and Part B will be assessed against the circumstances of

each scenario. As per the above section, where a custodian is able to demonstrate that factors
from Part B are present, the factors from Part A may be appropriately mitigated and therefore

notification is not required, but may still be given at the custodian’s discretion.

Risk of Harm Analysis Example 1 – Unauthorized Access:

Dr. Smith, in preparation for a patient’s visit, attempts to access the patient’s record on Alberta

Netcare to view the results of recent lab tests. After opening the record, Dr. Smith realizes that he
has opened the record of an individual with a similar name, but who is not his patient. Dr. Smith

immediately closed the file.

Risk of Harm Assessment Example 3 – Loss:

While providing IT services for a medical clinic, a computer technician misplaced a USB storage

device containing individually identifying health information of about 30 patients who visited the

medical clinic within the last week. The device could not be recovered. The information on the
device had been backed up and a copy of it remains in the clinic’s computer system. The device

was properly encrypted and password-protected.

In this case, the computer technician (an affiliate of the custodian(s) at the medical clinic) is the

Risk of Harm Assessment Example 5 – Unauthorized Disclosure:

A hospital clerk attempted to fax a referral form to a specialist, but accidentally used the wrong

fax number. The information was accidentally sent to the personal fax machine of a member of
the public, Ibadan Smith. Upon receipt of the form, Ibadan read the information in the referral

form and contacted the hospital to let them know what she had received. The hospital resent the
form to the correct number. The hospital also requested that Ibadan destroy or return the form to

the hospital but Ibadan refused to do either.

In this case, Ibadan Smith is the individual who received the unauthorized disclosure. The

hospital clerk (an affiliate of the regional health authority) is the individual who caused the

unauthorized disclosure. The regional health authority is the custodian responsible for assessing

Risk of Harm Assessment Example 6 – Unauthorized Disclosure:

While attempting to fax lab results to a specialist, a family physician accidentally faxed the

information to a dentist, Dr. Jones, instead. Recognizing that the fax was sent to her in error, Dr.
Jones shredded the results, but did not notify the referring family physician. The referring family

physician did not become aware of the incident until the intended recipient phoned the referring
family physician three days later. As the intended recipient did not receive the results in time,

urgently needed treatment for the patient was delayed. The family physician eventually
discovered where the fax was misdirected and ensured that it had been destroyed.

In this case, the family physician is the individual who caused the unauthorized disclosure and is

NOTIFICATION IS REQUIRED

Things to Consider

Where there is a risk of harm to an individual who is not the subject of the information, the Health
Information Act does not require the custodian to notify the Commissioner, Minister or individual.
A custodian may still wish to consider where a breach might pose a risk of harm to an individual

other than the subject of the information, and may still notify in such a situation if they so choose.

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

57

Similarly, a custodian may wish to inform an individual of any risk of harm that may exist to them

from a situation which does not involve a breach, such as if a dosage is incorrect on a
prescription.

14.7 Notification

If a custodian believes, as a result of their investigation and assessment, that there is a risk of
harm to an individual as a result of a loss, unauthorized access or disclosure, the custodian must
notify the Commissioner, Minister and individual(s) who are the subject of the individually

identifying health information (affected individual(s)) as soon as practicable.

The notice to the Commissioner, Minister or affected individual(s) should not contain any

individually identifying information, other than the information necessary to contact the

responsible custodian and the individual’s contact information as part of the notification to the
affected individual.

The notice to the Commissioner, Minister, and affected individual(s) is intended to be executed at
the same time; however, as a copy of the notice to the individual must be included in the notice to

the Commissioner, the notice to the individual must be prepared first. The notice to the affected

individual may precede the notice to the Commissioner and the Minister, if the custodian believes
the circumstances warrant urgent notice to the individual. This may also be the case where the

loss, unauthorized access or disclosure was brought to the attention of the custodian by the
affected individual, such as where an individual discovers an unauthorized access through the

review of their Alberta Netcare Audit Log.

Notice to the Commissioner and the Minister may precede the notice to the individual where the

custodian is requesting approval for substitutional notice to the individual.

A substitutional notice is served when notice cannot directly be given to the affected individual(s)
or when doing so would be impractical and might not be effective. Examples of substitutional

notices include television commercials and newspaper ads. Where a number of individuals have
been impacted by a breach, notification to the individuals must be completed by notifying each

individual separately, unless substitutional service is approved. Notification to the Commissioner
and the Minister regarding the same breach affecting numerous individuals can be completed by
submitting the Notification to the Commissioner Form and the Notification to Alberta’s
Minister of Health Form once to the appropriate office. The number of individuals to whom there
is a risk of harm must be identified on the notice.

58

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

14.7.1 Notification to Affected Individual(s)

Where a custodian has determined that a risk of harm exists as a result of the loss, unauthorized

access, or disclosure of individually identifying health information in the custody or control of the

custodian, the custodian must, as soon as practicable, notify the affected individual in a method
authorized by section 103 of the Health Information Act and must include the content
prescribed by section 8.2(4) of the Health Information Regulation.

If the custodian is aware that there would be a risk of harm to the individual’s mental or physical

health as a result of giving notice to the individual, the custodian may decide not to notify the
individual.

Where the custodian decides not to notify the individual, the custodian must immediately give
notice to the Commissioner of his or her decision as in accordance with section 8.3 of the

Edmonton, Alberta
T2T 2T2

Dear Ms. Concordance,

We regret to inform you that there has been an unauthorized access to your health
information. On February 28, 2015, an employee of Dr. Steven Jones inappropriately
accessed your diagnostic, treatment and care information contained in Netcare (the
Alberta Electronic Health Record).

This notice is being provided to you in accordance with the requirement to notify an
individual of an unauthorized access to their health information under section 60.1 of the
Health Information Act, and as a precautionary measure to prevent or reduce possible
risk of harm to you.

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

61

The type of information accessed by the employee was the results of your laboratory
tests. We have conducted a risk of harm assessment and determined that as this type of
information had the potential to cause harm, such as embarrassment, there is a potential
for misuse.

Disciplinary action against the employee is being considered and the employee’s access
to Netcare has been revoked. To prevent such actions from occurring in the future,
Ozero Clinic is requiring all employees to retake privacy and security training which will
address the appropriate use of Alberta Netcare.

If you have concerns regarding the privacy and security of your information in Netcare,
we would recommend you obtain a copy of your Netcare Audit Log. This log will show
the names of any individual who has accessed your Alberta Netcare record, the date this
access occurred and the activities the individual undertook while in your record. A
Netcare Audit Log can be obtained by contacting the Alberta Health Freedom of
Information and Protection of Privacy Office at 780-422-5111.

Please be advised that the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta has the
authority to investigate any contraventions of the Health Information Act. If you would
like to report any concerns to the Commissioner, please contact the Office of the

Information and Privacy Commissioner at 780-422-6860 (Toll-free at 1-888-878-4044) or

Public Notice of a Breach of Health Information

To all current and past patients of the Calgary Eye Clinic,

On February 28, 2015, the computer network of the Calgary Eye Clinic, under the
custodianship of Dr. Janine Decker, was hacked. We regret to advise that the health
information of about 1 million patients may have been exposed to the hacking attack.
Individuals who have received treatment at the Calgary Eye Clinic between January 1,
2008 and December 31, 2015 may have been affected by this incident. This notice is
being provided in accordance with section 60.1 of the Health Information Act.

Information that may have been exposed as a result of this incident includes registration
information such as: patient name, ethnicity, marital status, dependents’ information,
phone number and email. It also includes Personal Health Numbers, drivers’ license and
credit card numbers.

Due to the potential for misuse of the type of information involved in this incident, we
believe that the individuals whose information has been exposed may be at risk of

identity theft or fraud, potentially resulting in financial loss.

To determine if your information was involved in this incident, please call the clinic’s toll-
free number at 1-800-222-4444.

Additionally, you may call your credit card company and follow the directions given to
you in order to protect yourself from identity theft. You may also contact the credit
reporting companies at 1-800-000-0000 or 1-877-111-1111 and advise them of this
incident, if your information is involved. Affected individuals are advised to monitor their
financial account and immediately contact their respective financial institutions or credit
card companies if they notice any discrepancies.

The Calgary Eye Clinic is working in conjunction with the Information and Privacy
Commissioner, credit card companies, credit-reporting agencies and the RCMP to
resolve this issue and reduce any potential risk of harm to our patients identified above.

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

63

The Personal Health Number allows individuals to receive publicly funded services paid
for by the Alberta Health Care Insurance Plan, such as doctor’s check-ups. A Personal
Health number can be monitored by requesting a Statement of Benefits Paid from
Alberta Health. To request a Statement of Benefits Paid, please contact Alberta Health

(h)  any other information that the custodian considers relevant.

The Checklist for Notification, found in Appendix 3, can assist custodians in ensuring they
have met all of the notification requirements. An example of a completed notification form is also
found in Appendix 3.

14.8 Compliance with the Duty to Notify

To ensure compliance with the duty to notify, a custodian should consider the following steps:

1.  Designation of Affiliate Responsible for Compliance with Duty to Notify

2.  Creation of a Duty to Notify Policy
3.  Organizational Awareness of Requirements and Policy/Process

4.  Audit and Update of Organizational Procedures

14.8.1 Designation of Affiliate Responsible for
Compliance with Duty to Notify

Within a custodian’s organization, a custodian should designate a specific affiliate or affiliates
who are responsible for meeting the requirements of section 60.1 of the Health Information
Act. Depending on the needs of the organization, options include the custodian, a single affiliate,
or multiple affiliates. Throughout this chapter, we will refer to this individual as the responsible
affiliate.

Any affiliate of the custodian may be designated as the responsible affiliate. This could be a clinic

manager, clerk, nurse, physician or a clinic privacy officer responsible for compliance with the
Health Information Act.

Some large custodian organizations, such as those with multiple facilities, may require multiple
responsible affiliates, one being the central privacy office. However, any one of the responsible

affiliates in the multiple responsible affiliate organization should have the authority to administer
the prevention and management of an incident within their area of practice or control. For

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

67

example, the responsible affiliate for a hospital department may notify a central responsible

affiliate in the hospital’s main privacy office, but the department’s responsible affiliate is able to
independently make decisions on risk mitigation and notification for each incident.

Where the custodian’s policy designates an affiliate as responsible for compliance with the duty to
notify, an affiliate’s notification to the responsible affiliate is deemed as a notice to the custodian
and the affiliate has met its duty under section 60.1(1) of the Health Information Act.

14.8.2 Policies and Procedures

In accordance with section 63 of the Health Information Act, a custodian must have in place
policies and procedures that will assist in the administration of the Act, including a policy for

responding to a loss, unauthorized access or disclosure. When creating a policy regarding

compliance with the duty to notify, or updating an existing policy, a custodian should consider any
existing policies and procedures they have in place with regards to mitigation, incident response,

or notification.

A policy should include the following information, as well as any additional information the

custodian deems relevant:

A statement regarding the purpose of the policy;

•  Who the policy applies to;

•  Steps the custodian will take to be in compliance with section 60.1 of the Health

Information Act; including, but not limited to:

-  How affiliates will comply with the requirement to notify the custodian of any loss,

unauthorized access or disclosure;

-  How the custodian will assess risk;

-  How the custodian will notify the Commissioner, Minister, and any affected individual(s),

where applicable;

•  How the custodian will contain and mitigate any loss, unauthorized access or disclosure;

•

If any exceptions apply to the policy;

•  Who within the custodian organization is responsible for:

-  Reviewing and updating the policy;

-  Receiving notifications from affiliates;

-  Containment and mitigation strategies;

68

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

-  Assessing risk of harm;

-  Notification to Minister, Commissioner and affected individual(s), where required;

•  Any requirements on the custodian to notify other entities of an incident (such as a regulatory

body or law enforcement agency);

•  Any penalties or consequences set either by the Health Information Act or by the custodian

for failing to meet the policy requirements;

•  The date the policy is effective;

•  Contact information for someone within the custodian’s organization who can answer an

affiliate’s questions about the policy; and

•  References or links to any applicable resources to assist with understanding or complying

with the policy (e.g. a link to the Breach Reporting Form, or where applicable, the
organization’s form for reporting a loss, unauthorized access or disclosure by an affiliate).

14.8.3 Organizational Awareness of Requirements
and Policy/Procedures

In order to ensure that a custodian is meeting the requirements of the duty to notify, the custodian
should ensure that all affiliates are sufficiently aware of their responsibilities. Examples include:

•  Providing education about affiliates’ responsibilities under the new notification requirement

under section 60.1 of the Health Information Act;

•  Training affiliates on the custodian’s notification policy;

•  Providing education to affiliates on incident prevention and mitigation;

•  Educating affiliates on the existence of internal and external audit functions, monitoring and

tracking mechanisms in respect to the organization’s handling of health information;

•  Referring affiliates to internal policies, or to publicly available resources, on the new reporting

requirement;

•  Conducting a response to a mock incident to assess the organization’s preparedness to

respond to a real incident;

•  Assessing preparedness by using lessons learned from previous responses to actual

incidents;

•

If applicable, ensuring that the organization’s web resources are updated with the new
requirements; and

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

69

•  Providing links to relevant web-based resources regarding the new requirement on the

custodian’s website(s).

14.8.4 Audit and Update of Organizational
Procedures

The June 2014 amendments to the Health Information Act also make it an offence to fail to take

reasonable steps in accordance with the regulations to maintain administrative, technical and

physical safeguards that will protect against any reasonably anticipated threat or hazard to the

security or integrity of health information or of loss of health information. As such, custodians
should regularly conduct an audit of their internal procedures and safeguards and update them as

necessary. This may include:

•  Reviewing administrative, physical, and technical controls for the protection of health

information;

•  Reviewing existing monitoring, tracking, and response procedures;

•  Consulting with other staff to update records and information management policies with the

new notification requirements;

•  Reviewing internal collection, use and disclosure practices, as well as practices regarding the

secure destruction of records; and

•  Establishing a schedule for reviewing administrative, technical and physical safeguards.

Ensure these practices and policies are in alignment with the Health Information Act, and update

as necessary.

14.9 Responding to a Loss, Unauthorized Access or
Disclosure

In addition to a notification policy, custodians should also have a procedure in place for
responding to a loss, unauthorized access or disclosure within their organization. Some areas of

this procedure may overlap with the notification policy, or the policy may direct affiliates to the
procedure.

An incident response procedure should address the following six steps for responding to a loss,

unauthorized access or disclosure within the custodian’s organization:

70

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

1.  Initiate organizational incident response procedure

The affiliate who becomes aware of the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure should notify the
custodian or responsible affiliate as per the custodian’s policy and section 8.2(1) of the Health
Information Regulation.

•  Steps may include:

-  Notifying the custodian, in accordance with the custodian’s policies and procedures, that

a loss, unauthorized access or disclosure has occurred.

-  Ensuring that notice is also available in written format, notwithstanding the manner in

which notice is provided to the custodian.

  For example, supplement a phone call with an email or a record of the

phone call.

-  Confirming that the custodian has received the notice.

  For example, follow up on a voicemail message left for the custodian or

request a “read receipt” when sending email to the custodian.

2.  Contain the incident & mitigate risk

The custodian should attempt to contain the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure to prevent

any further risk of harm. This may include recalling a misdirected email or fax, attempting to
retrieve misplaced files, or shutting down an area of weakness within the computer’s security

system. Depending on the custodian’s incident response procedure, affiliates may be required to
take some containment steps before receiving direction from the custodian. This may be the case

where immediate action could help to mitigate risk, such as where an affiliate immediately

realizes that they have sent an email to the wrong address. In circumstances such as this, the
custodian’s policy or procedure may direct them to attempt to recall the message immediately,

before notifying the custodian.

An incident response procedure may require:

•  Contacting support personnel (such as IT staff) needed to assist with containment.

•  Notification of affected individuals immediately if immediate notice will help reduce risk of

harm to them.

-  Note: At this point, the custodian may not have all the information required by the

regulations, therefore a second notification to the affected individual may be necessary if
this immediate notice does not meet the requirements.

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

71

•  Facilitation of notification to relevant health professionals if, for example, the loss or theft of
health information may jeopardize the delivery of urgently needed health services to an

individual (for example, if a test result is lost and the individual requires immediate health
care based on the outcome of that test result).

•  Consideration as to whether creating a general awareness within the organization is

necessary for containing the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure.

•  Participation of relevant staff within the organization in the containment and investigation of

the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure.

-  For example, in the case of a lost laptop, the support of other staff may be needed to find

it.

•  An initial incident report to be used in notification (as applicable) to:

-

Internal authorities, e.g. the custodian, legal counsel, communications team;

-  Other organizations based on contractual obligations; and/or

-  The police if the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure involves theft or criminal activity.

3.  Investigate the loss, unauthorized access, or disclosure

The custodian should investigate the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure of individually

identifying health information. This should include identification of:

•  The cause of the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure (e.g. was this a case of an affiliate

snooping? A lost access card? A misdirected fax? A hacking incident?);

•  The root cause of the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure (e.g. did the affiliate snoop

because they were unaware of the custodian’s policies? Was the hacking able to take place

because the security safeguards were insufficient?);

•  Whether the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure was intentional or accidental;

•  Whether the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure could have been avoided;

•  The date and time, or time period of the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure;

•  The date the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure was discovered;

•  The types of information involved in the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure;

•  The safeguards that were in place at the time of incident;

•  An estimate or exact number of individuals who may be affected by the loss, unauthorized

access or disclosure;

72

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

•  Any initial steps the custodian has taken to contain the loss, unauthorized access or

disclosure and mitigate risk to those involved;

•  Whether the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure was an isolated incident or indicates

systemic issues; and

•  Which affiliates or service providers were involved or impacted by the breach.

The custodian should exercise discretion to ensure that the process of containment or risk

assessment does not result in any further loss, unauthorized access or disclosure.

•  For example, the custodian should refrain as much as possible, from revealing any

information that could lead to the identification of the individual whose health information has
been lost, accessed or disclosed inappropriately.

•

In addition, unless otherwise needed for the success of the investigation, containment, or risk
assessment and notification, making the identity of the person responsible for the loss,

unauthorized access or disclosure known to the general staff should be avoided.

4.  Assess for risk of harm

The custodian must assess whether there is a risk of harm to an individual as a result of a loss,

unauthorized access or disclosure of individually identifying health information.

•  This assessment must be done in consideration of the factors set out in section 8.1(1) of the
Health Information Regulation, as well as any other factor(s) the custodian deems relevant.

•  Based on all available information, the custodian must determine whether a risk of harm

exists to an individual.

•

If the custodian has established that a risk of harm exists to an individual, notification to the
Commissioner, Minister and any affected individual(s) is required.

Section 14.6 and Appendix 3 of the HIA Guidelines and Practices Manual refer to more
information on assessing risk of harm.

5.  Notify (if required)

Where the custodian determines that there is a risk of harm to the individual who is the subject of

the information as a result of the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure of individually identifying
health information in the custody or control of the custodian, the custodian must notify the

Minister, Commissioner, and any affected individual(s) in accordance with the regulations as soon
as practicable. If the individual was notified as part of the containment or risk mitigation process,

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

73

and the notification met all the requirements of the regulations, a secondary notice to the

individual is not required.

Where there is a risk of harm to an individual who is not the subject of the information, the

custodian should consider whether notification to that individual or another individual is necessary
to appropriately mitigate that risk.

Section 14.7 and Appendix 3 of the HIA Guidelines and Practices Manual provide more
information on notification.

6.  Monitor, Track, and Learn

After a loss, unauthorized access or disclosure of individually identifying health information has

been contained, the custodian should, as appropriate:

•  Prepare an Investigation Report for internal documentation, which should include:

-  A summary of the incident;

-  The immediate response taken to contain the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure

and reduce harm;

-  Background of the incident;

  Timelines;
  Type(s) of information involved;

-  Description of the investigative process;

-  Summary of interviews held (internally and externally);

-  A review of safeguards and protocols;

-  Summary of possible solutions and recommendations;

-  Description of necessary remedial actions, including short and long term strategies to

correct the situation;

-  Detailed description of next steps;

-  Responsibility for implementation and monitoring, including timelines;

  May also include the names and positions of individuals responsible for

implementation.

•  Monitor the situation for any future risks;

74

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

•  Provide the Minister with further clarification on the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure

that has been reported, if requested;

•  Respond to further enquiries by the Commissioner and cooperate with the Commissioner in

conducting investigations, where applicable;

•  Respond to requests for further explanations or clarifications from any affected individual(s).

-  Consider recommending appropriate disciplinary actions against persons responsible in

accordance with section 8(7) of the Health Information Regulation;

-  Determine whether this loss, unauthorized access or disclosure is systemic in nature and,

if so, consider what needs to be done to stop it;

-  Determine measures that may need to be put in place to prevent this type of loss,

unauthorized access or disclosure from occurring again;

-  Consider conducting a review of the organization’s information security practices,

including updates to physical, administrative, and technical controls, where necessary;

-  Consider whether the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure and decisions made in
respect of it, are a learning opportunity for the organization as a whole and coordinate

efforts to disseminate this learning to the organization in a way that prevents further
incidents; and

-  Retain investigation results via a secure tracking method.

14.10  Prevention

To help prevent a loss, unauthorized access or disclosure from occurring, it is recommended that

custodians:

Things to Remember

Duty to Notify

What is a Loss, Unauthorized Access or Disclosure?

•  A loss occurs where information, which was once in the custody or under the control of a

custodian, is no longer in the custody or under the control of that custodian. This may involve

a physical or electronic loss of records in contravention of the Act.

•  An unauthorized access occurs where an individual accesses information that they were not

authorized to access.

•  An unauthorized disclosure occurs where there has been a deliberate or accidental

disclosure of information in contravention of the Health Information Act.

What are my Duties as a Custodian?

•  Where a custodian becomes aware of a loss, unauthorized access or disclosure of

individually identifying health information, the custodian must assess whether there is a risk

of harm to an individual as a result of the loss, unauthorized access or disclosure.

•  Where the custodian determines that there is a risk of harm, the custodian must notify, as

soon as practicable, the Commissioner, Minister, and any affected individual(s), in
accordance with the regulations.

•

If a custodian considers that giving notice to an individual who is the subject of individually
identifying health information that has been breached could reasonably be expected to result

in a risk of harm to the individual’s mental or physical health, the custodian may decide not to
give notice to the individual. If the custodian decides not to give notice to the subject, then the

custodian must immediately give notice to the Commissioner of their decision not to give
notice to the individual. Such a notice to the Commissioner must include the reasons for this

decision, in accordance with the regulations.

What are my Duties as an Affiliate?

•  Where an affiliate becomes aware of a loss, unauthorized access or disclosure of individually
identifying health information, the affiliate must, as soon as practicable, notify the responsible
custodian in accordance with section 8.2(1) of the Health Information Regulation.

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

77

What is the Level of Risk Requiring Notification?

A level of risk requiring notification exists where:

•  8.1(1)(a) there is a reasonable basis to believe that the information has been or may be

accessed by or disclosed to a person;

•  8.1(1)(b) there is a reasonable basis to believe that the information has been misused or will

be misused;

•  8.1(1)(c) there is a reasonable basis to believe that the information could be used for the

purpose of identity theft or to commit fraud;

•  8.1(1)(d) there is a reasonable basis to believe that the information is of a type that could

cause embarrassment or physical, mental or financial harm to or damage the reputation of
the individual who is the subject of the information;

•  8.1(1)(e) there is a reasonable basis to believe that the loss of or unauthorized access to or
disclosure of the information has adversely affected or will adversely affect the provision of a

health service to the individual who is the subject of the information;

•  There are other relevant factors that could result in risk of harm.

The risk of harm has been appropriately mitigated, and notification is not required where:

•  8.1(1)(f) in the case of electronic information, the custodian is able to demonstrate that the

information was encrypted or otherwise secured in a manner that would

i.

prevent the information from being accessed by a person who is not authorized

to access the information, or
render the information unintelligible by a person who is not authorized to access

ii.

the information;

•  8.1(1)(g) in the case of a loss of information, the custodian is able to demonstrate that the

information was lost in circumstances in which the information was

i.

ii.

destroyed, or

rendered inaccessible or unintelligible;

•  8.1(1)(h) in the case of a loss of information that is subsequently recovered by the custodian,

the custodian can demonstrate that the information was not accessed before it was
recovered;

78

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES MANUAL | Chapter 14 Duty to Notify

•  8.1(1)(i) in the case of an unauthorized access to or disclosure of information, the custodian
is able to demonstrate that the only person who accessed the information or to whom the

information was disclosed

i.

ii.

iii.

iv.

is a custodian or an affiliate,

is subject to confidentiality policies and procedures that meet the requirements of

section 60 of the Act,
accessed the information in a manner that is in accordance with the person’s

duties as a custodian or affiliate and not for an improper purpose, and
did not use or disclose the information except in determining that the information

was accessed by or disclosed to the person in error and in taking any steps
reasonably necessary to address the unauthorized access or disclosure.

•  There are other relevant factors that would mitigate the risk.
