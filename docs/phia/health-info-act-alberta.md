 1.1

PURPOSE OF THE MANUAL

The Health Information Act and the regulations made under it establish the rules that must be
followed for the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health information in the health
sector. The Health Information Act Guidelines and Practices Manual is designed as a reference
tool to help custodians and affiliates apply and administer the Act.

The Manual is intended to explain the legislation and to offer guidance on approaches,
procedures and best practices. The information contained in the Manual is not meant to
present binding rules. Any examples used are illustrative only and should not be used as
authority for any decisions made under the Act.

The chapters of the Manual generally follow the scheme and order of the Act. A few chapters
have been added to cover administrative processes and the first chapter is an overall
introduction to the Act. At the back of many of the chapters are ‘Things to Remember’. These
pages include bullet summaries of the important things to remember in the preceding chapter
and, in some cases, decision flow charts or tables. They are meant to be used by readers as
quick reminders or checklists about a particular topic but are not meant as a substitute for the
more comprehensive chapter content or for referring to the Act and the regulations.

The Act and regulations can be found at: http://www.qp.alberta.ca/

There are a number of Appendices at the back of the Manual. These include forms, model
letters, a detailed implementation checklist and components for agreements under the Act.

Best practices and examples used in the Manual should be considered as guidelines only. They
are in boxes accompanying the text.

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

 1.2

PURPOSES OF THE HEALTH INFORMATION ACT

The purposes of the Act are set out in section 2. They are:

 • To establish strong and effective mechanisms to protect the privacy of individuals with
respect to their health information and to protect the confidentiality of that information;
 • To enable health information to be shared and accessed, where appropriate, to provide

health services and to manage the health system;

 • To prescribe rules for the collection, use and disclosure of health information, which are to
be carried out in the most limited manner and with the highest degree of anonymity that is
possible in the circumstances;

 • To provide individuals with a right of access to health information about themselves,

subject to the limited and specific exceptions as set out in the Act;

 • To provide individuals with a right to request correction or amendment of health

information about themselves;

 • To establish strong and effective remedies for contravention of the Act; and
 • To provide for the Information and Privacy Commissioner to conduct independent reviews
of decisions made by custodians under the Act and to investigate and resolve complaints.

 1.3

INTRODUCTION TO THE HEALTH INFORMATION ACT

The Health Information Act contains rules about the collection, use and disclosure of health
information and aims to make the process transparent to those involved in the health system
as well as to the general public. The rules are intended to protect the privacy of individuals
and the confidentiality of their health information; ensure that health information is shared
appropriately; and ensure that health records are managed and protected properly.

 1.3.1

PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE LEGISLATION

•	 Custodians	are	responsible	for	maintaining,	protecting	and	safeguarding	health

information.

A “custodian” is an organization or individual in the health system who receives and uses
health information and is responsible for ensuring that it is protected, used and disclosed
appropriately.

“Custodian” is defined in section 1(1)(f) to include organizations such as Alberta Health
Services and provincial health boards; health service providers designated in the regulations
as a custodian or who are within a class of health service providers that is designated in the
regulations; and the Minister and Department.

The definition of custodian does not include everyone who may collect or use health
information in the course of their work. It also does not include other provincial government
departments and agencies or local public bodies such as schools, post-secondary institutions
and municipalities.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

•	 Custodians	are	the	trusted	“gatekeepers”	of	an	individual’s	health	information.

Custodians must determine whether the amount and type of information to be collected,
used and disclosed is necessary and appropriate to achieve an authorized purpose under the
Act; whether they have authority to collect, use or disclose the information; and whether any
expressed wishes of the individual are considered before disclosure, along with other factors.

•	 Individuals	have	the	right	to	access	their	own	health	information,	to	ask	for	it	to	be

corrected	and	to	know	why	it	is	being	collected.

Individuals have a right to examine or review their own health information and to ask for
copies, explanations, and corrections or amendments to be made to it.

When a custodian asks an individual for specific health information, the custodian must take
reasonable steps to explain why the information is being collected, under what legal authority
it is being collected and who the individual can contact if there are any questions about the
collection.

Custodians are expected to make a notation every time a record containing individually
identifying diagnostic, treatment or care information is disclosed without consent and to
allow the individual in question to have access to this notation. The requirement to make
such a note does not apply to a custodian that permits other custodians electronic access to
individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information stored in a database if,
when the information is disclosed, the database automatically keeps an electronic log of such
information.

•	 Personal	health	numbers	of	individuals	are	protected.

Only custodians and others designated by a regulation under the Act can require an individual
to provide their personal health number (section 21). Section 5(2) of the Health Information
Regulation designates certain persons or organizations and the specific purposes for which they
are authorized to require the provision of personal health numbers.

Examples of those designated by the regulation include insurers for the purpose of facilitating
the handling, assessing and payment of claims for benefits; the Workers’ Compensation Board
for the purpose of facilitating the handling, assessing and payment of claims for benefits;
persons, other than custodians, who provide health services to individuals for the purpose of
seeking reimbursement for providing those services from the Alberta Health Care Insurance
Plan; and the Minister of Seniors and Community Supports for the purpose of administering the
Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped Program.

An individual can refuse to give his/her personal health number to anyone who is not covered
by section 21 of the Act.

However, for example an individual may continue to provide his or her child’s personal health
number to private daycare operators or babysitters if they so choose.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

•	 There	are	limits	on	the	collection,	use	and	disclosure	of	health	information.

As an overall principle, only the least amount of information at the highest degree of
anonymity can be collected, used and disclosed (sections	57,	58).

Custodians are expected to only collect, use and disclose essential information and, wherever
possible, to do so in a way that does not identify an individual.

•	 When	health	information	identifies	an	individual,	there	are	specific	rules	for	its

collection,	use	and	disclosure.

If the information is non-identifying information, that is, either individually anonymous
information or aggregate information (about groups of individuals with common
characteristics), custodians may collect, use and disclose that information for any purpose.

•	 Individually	identifying	health	information	may	be	collected	and	used	by	custodians	for

authorized	purposes	as	set	out	in	section	27.

Those authorized purposes include such things as providing health services to the individual;
determining whether an individual is eligible for services under the Alberta Health Care
Insurance Plan and conducting investigations or practice reviews of health professionals. For
a complete list of authorized purposes under section	27,	see	section	1.3.2	of	this	Chapter	and
also	section	7.4	in	Chapter	7	of	this	Publication.

In addition, the Minister, the Department, and Alberta Health Services may use individually
identifying health information for planning and resource allocation; health system
management; public health surveillance; and health policy development within the geographic
area in which they have jurisdiction to promote the objectives for which the custodian is
responsible.

•	 As	a	general	rule,	an	individual’s	consent	is	required	before	individually	identifying

health	information	is	disclosed	(section	34).

•	 However,	individually	identifying	diagnostic,	treatment	and	care	information	may	be

disclosed	without	an	individual’s	consent	to	the	persons	and	for	the	purposes	set	out	in
sections	35,	37.1,	37.3,	38,	39,	40,	46	and	47.

Some of those discretionary	disclosures include disclosure to another custodian for a purpose
listed in section 27; to a person responsible for giving continuing care to the individual; to
family members or others with a close personal relationship, unless the individual expressly
requests that family and friends not be informed; and to police to prevent or limit fraud or
abuse of health services or to protect public health and safety. This is not an exhaustive list.

•	 Individually	identifying	registration	information	may	be	disclosed	by	a	custodian	without

the	individual’s	consent	in	the	situations	set	out	in	sections	36,	38,	40,	46	and	47.

Some of those discretionary	disclosures include disclosure to any person for the purpose
of collecting or processing a fine or debt owing by the individual to the Government or to a
custodian; and disclosure for any of the purposes for which diagnostic, treatment and care
information may be disclosed under section 35(1)	or	(4).

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

•	 Individually	identifying	registration	information	and	diagnostic,	treatment	and	care
information may	only	be	disclosed	for	research	purposes	by	a	custodian,	without
the	individual’s	consent,	under	the	conditions	set	out	in	Part	5	(Disclosure	of	Health
Information),	Division	3	(Disclosure	for	Research	Purposes).

Before individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information or registration
information may be disclosed for research, the research proposal must have been assessed by
a research ethics board designated by the Minister; the researcher must agree to comply with
the conditions stated in section	53;	and the researcher must enter into an agreement with the
custodian to comply with the conditions set out in section 54.

•	 There	are	rules	for	the	disclosure	of	electronic	health	information	set	out	in	section	60.

The rules governing the disclosure of the least amount of information with the highest degree
of anonymity apply to information stored and shared electronically. Custodians must have
technical and physical safeguards in place to protect records and information in any form,
including records and information collected and stored electronically.

•	 There	are	rules	for	the	disclosure	by	a	custodian	of	individually	identifiable	health

information	to	the	Minister	or	Department	for	health	system	purposes	listed	in	section	27
(section	46).

Privacy impact assessments describing how the disclosure may affect the privacy of the
individual subject must be submitted to the Information and Privacy Commissioner for
comment before the information can be disclosed to the Minister or to the Department.

•	 There	are	rules	for	Alberta	Health	Services	or	the	Health	Quality	Council	of	Alberta

requesting	another	custodian	to	disclose	individually	identifying	health	information	for
health	system	purposes	listed	in	section	27	(section	47).

One of the above custodians may request another custodian to disclose individually identifying
health information for any of the purposes listed in section 27(2) under certain circumstances.

For example, the requesting custodian may be authorized to obtain the information by an
enactment of Alberta or Canada; or the information may relate to a health service provided by
another custodian that is provided using financial, physical or human resources provided or
administered by the requesting custodian.

If the disclosure is not authorized by another enactment of Alberta or Canada, the disclosing
custodian may, under section	47(2),	refuse to disclose the information if disclosure could result
in immediate and grave harm to the subject of the information; could harm another individual
or pose a threat to public safety. Any such dispute may be resolved by the Commissioner.

•	 The	Information	and	Privacy	Commissioner	plays	a	key	role	in	providing	an	independent

review	and	monitoring	function	under	the	Act.

The Commissioner is responsible for reviewing decisions of custodians and affiliates under the
Act; conducting investigations; providing advice; and resolving disputes.

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

•	 There	are	penalties	for	breaking	the	rules	for	collection,	use	and	disclosure	of	health

information.

It is an offence under the Act to collect, use, disclose or create health information in
contravention of the Act. There are other offences set out in sections	106	and	107	of the Act.

 1.3.2  HOW THE ACT WORKS

“Custodians” of health information are health services providers or organizations that are
in the health sector (defined	in	section	1(1)(f)), who have “health	information”	(defined	in
section	1(1)(k))	in their custody or under their control. This information includes:

 • “diagnostic,	treatment	and	care	information” (information about an individual’s health

and health services provided to the individual) (section 1(1)(i)); or

 • “registration	information” (six categories including specified demographic information
about an individual) (section	1(1)(u)	of the Act and further defined in section	3 of the
Health Information Regulation).

Custodians are authorized to use “individually	identifying”	(section	1(1)(p))	health
information to carry out the purposes in section 27 (1) including:

 • Providing health services;
 • Determining or verifying an individual’s eligibility to obtain health services;
 • Conducting investigations, discipline proceedings, practice reviews or inspections relating

to the members of a health profession or health discipline;

 • conducting research or performing data matching or other services to facilitate research

that has been assessed by a research ethics board;

 • providing health service provider education;
 • carrying out specific purposes identified in other legislation (e.g., Hospitals Act, Regional

Health Authorities Act, Public Health Act); and

 • internal management, including planning, resource allocation, policy development, quality
improvement, monitoring, audit, evaluation, reporting, obtaining or processing payment
for health services and human resource management.

Some custodians (e.g., the Minister, the Department, and Alberta Health Services) are
authorized to use individually identifying health information for:

 • planning and resource allocation;
 • health system management;
 • public health surveillance; and
 • health policy development (section 27(2)).

There is a boundary or “controlled	arena” around the custodians who are subject to the Act.
Subject to certain provisions in the Act, individually identifying health information can move
from one custodian to another within that controlled arena for the authorized purposes in
section 27. Outside the arena, the movement of individually identifying health information is
more restricted.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

Even within the “controlled	arena”,	certain provisions in the Act create barriers that restrict the
flow of health information. These provisions include:

 • the duty of a custodian to consider the expressed wishes of an individual regarding the

disclosure of individually identifying health information (section	58(2));

 • the need for the individual to consent to the disclosure of individually identifying health
information (section	34)	except for the discretionary disclosures in Part	5	(Disclosure	of
Health Information);

 • the duty of a custodian to collect, use or disclose individually identifying health

information with the highest degree of anonymity possible (section 57);

 • the duty of a custodian to collect, use or disclose the least amount of individually

identifying health information (section	58);

 • the duty of an affiliate to collect, use or disclose health information in a manner that is in
accordance with the affiliate’s responsibilities as determined by their custodian (‘need to
know’ basis) (sections	24,	28,	43);

 • the duty of a custodian to protect the confidentiality of health information (section	60);
 • the need for custodians to prepare privacy impact assessments (sections	46,	64,	70,

and	71);

 • the duty of a custodian to make notations of disclosures of records of individually

identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information without consent (section 41);

 • the Commissioner’s power to make orders (section	80); and
 • offences and penalties that apply to custodians, affiliates and, in some cases, to all

Albertans (section	107).

The Act recognizes the need to disclose health information in certain circumstances, without
consent, beyond the controlled arena to, among others:

 • a person providing continuing treatment and care to the individual;
 • those requiring information as outlined in other legislation;
 • A court or a quasi-judicial body;
 • any person to comply with a subpoena, court order or warrant in Alberta;
 • any person to avert or minimize an imminent danger to the health or safety of any person;
 • any person to act in the best interests of an individual who lacks the mental capacity to

provide a consent;

 • family members, those with close personal relationships and descendents for specified

purposes and under certain conditions; and

 • The police or Minister of Justice and Attorney General to prevent or limit fraud or abuse of

health services and to protect public health and safety.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

For disclosure, without consent, outside the controlled arena, the same rules apply as for
disclosure within the controlled arena. For instance:

 • The custodian must act as the trusted gatekeeper of the information;
 • Informed consent and expressed wishes of the individual must still be considered;
 • The custodian must only disclose the least amount of information at the highest degree of

anonymity;

 • The custodian must protect the information while it is in transit to the recipient of the

information, even if that recipient is in another province or country; and

 • The custodian must make a notation of disclosure without consent of a record containing
individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information unless otherwise noted.

There are additional requirements that apply to disclosure by a custodian of individually
identifying health information outside the controlled arena. The custodian must:

 • notify the recipient of the custodian’s authority to disclose and the purpose of the

disclosure;

 • take reasonable steps to ensure that the person who will receive the information is the

person intended and is authorized to receive it; and

 • ensure that a researcher submits the research project for review by an approved research

ethics board and to comply with the requirements of the board.

Recipients of health information both inside and outside the controlled arena are:

 • prohibited from using the information for direct commercial marketing or fundraising

purposes without consent;

 • prohibited from taking steps to re-identify an individual from non-identifying information

without first notifying the Information and Privacy Commissioner; and

 • prohibited from requiring a person to provide their personal health number, unless they are

on an approved list in the regulations and do not use it for additional purposes.

 1.4

TO WHAT AND TO WHOM DOES THE HEALTH INFORMATION ACT APPLY?

The Act applies to “health	information”	about an individual that is collected, used or disclosed
by “custodians”	and “affiliates” in the health system.

 1.4.1

TO WHAT INFORMATION DOES THE HEALTH INFORMATION ACT APPLY?

The Act applies to “health	information” about an individual. “Health	information” includes
any or all of the following two types of information: (section	1(1)(k))

 • “diagnostic,	treatment	and	care	information”	(section	1(1)(i));	and
 • “registration	information”	(section	(1)(u)).

“Diagnostic,	treatment	and	care	information” is the most sensitive information about an
individual’s health and the health services provided to that individual, including the cost of
those services. The most stringent rules in the Act apply to this category of health information.

Health and Wellness

11

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

A custodian may only disclose individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care
information to a person other than the individual who is the subject of the information (or
their authorized representative) if the individual (or their authorized representative) has
consented to the disclosure. There are some exceptions to consent when disclosure of the
information is for the purposes set out in sections	35	(1)	through	(4),	37.1,	37.3,	46	and	47.

Diagnostic,	treatment	and	care	information	includes	information	about	the	following:

 • the physical and mental health of an individual;
 • a “health	service” (as	defined	in	section	1(1)(m))	provided to an individual for the

purposes of:
–  protecting, promoting or maintaining physical and mental health;
–  preventing illness;
–  diagnosing and treating illness;
–  rehabilitation; or
–  caring for the health needs of the ill, disabled, injured or dying;

 • donation by an individual of a body part or substance, including information derived from

the testing or examination of a body part or bodily substance;

 • a drug as defined in the Pharmacy and Drug Act provided to an individual;
 • a health care aid, device, product, equipment or other item provided to an individual

pursuant to a prescription or other authorization;

 • the amount of any benefit paid or payable under the Alberta Health Care Insurance Act or
any other amount paid or payable in respect of a health service provided to an individual;
and

 • any other information about an individual that is collected when a health service
is provided to the individual but does not include information that is not written,
photographed, recorded or stored in some manner in a record.

Diagnostic,	treatment	and	care	information	about	an	individual	includes	a	subset	of
information	about	the	health	service	provider	attending	to	the	individual.	That	subset	of
information	includes	the	following	elements:

 • name;
 • business title;
 • business mailing address and business electronic address;
 • business telephone number and business facsimile number;
 • type of health services provider;
 • licence number or any other number assigned to the health services provider by a health

professional body to identify that health services provider;

 • profession;
 • job classification;
 • employer;

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

 • municipality in which the health services provider’s practice is located;
 • provincial service provider identification number that is assigned to the health services

provider by the Minister to identify the health services provider;

 • any other information specified in the regulations.

An example of “other information collected” would be certain information about an
individual’s authorized representative under section 104(1)(c) to (i). Because the role of a
parent or guardian of a child is inextricably linked to the individual’s diagnostic, treatment
and care information, the name, address, phone number, signature etc. of that representative
could also be included as diagnostic, treatment and care information. When the consent
of an authorized representative is required to provide health services to e.g., a minor, the
demographic information of the minor’s authorized representative is linked to the provision of
that health service.

“Health	services”	provided to populations include public health and community health services
such as health screening programs (e.g., breast cancer screening program).

“Donation	of	a	bodily	substance”	could include organ donations, donation of blood or blood
products tissue samples retained by the and laboratory specimens.

A “health	service”	does not include a service excluded by the regulations.

Section	3.1	of	the	Health	Information	Act	Regulation	(HIAR)	allows	for	the	exclusion	of	some
services	from	the	definition	of	“health	services”,	and	thus	from	the	application	of	HIA.

The	following	services	will	be	excluded	from	the	definition	of	health	services:
(a)  the review, interpretation or assessment by a health services provider of

(i)

results from a drug or alcohol test performed by a laboratory on a bodily
substance from an individual, but only to the extent necessary or reasonably
required to determine the individual’s fitness to work,

(ii)  results from medical, health or biological monitoring of an individual or

from health surveillance of an individual, but only to the extent necessary
or reasonably required to protect the health of workers or to determine the
individual’s fitness to work, or

(iii)  results of a medical assessment of an individual to assess the individual’s fitness

to work;

(b)  the review, interpretation or assessment of health information about workers collected
under the Occupational Health and Safety Act by the Director of Medical Services for
the purposes of protecting the health and safety of workers;

(c)  an independent medical examination of an individual, or a review of the health

information of an individual, by a health services provider who is not involved in
the treatment and care of the individual for the purpose of determining benefits or
coverage, or both, for insurance purposes;

13

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

(d)  services, including parenting psychological assessments, neuro-psychological

assessments and individual or group counselling, provided by psychologists to
children and families at the request of a director under the Child, Youth and Family
Enhancement Act;

(e)  the review, interpretation or assessment by a health services provider of results
from a drug or alcohol test performed by a laboratory on a bodily substance
from an individual at the request of a director under the Child, Youth and Family
Enhancement Act.

(f)  emergency response dispatch services.

A “health service” does not include a service provided by a Community or Facility Board
(P.D.D. Board) as those terms are defined in the Persons with Developmental Disabilities
Community Governance Act other than a Community Board that is designated in the regulations
as a custodian.

 • P.D.D. Boards collect and create “care information” about individuals. The information is
used for such purposes as determining an individual’s level of functionality during intake.

 • Information in the custody or under the control of P.D.D. Boards is subject to the access

and privacy protection provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of
Privacy Act.

“Diagnostic,	treatment	and	care	information”	only refers to recorded information. It does	not
include information that is not written, photographed, recorded or stored in some manner in a
record (section 1(1)(i)).

“Registration	information” means the basic information collected when individuals register to
receive health services. It is primarily used to determine whether a person is eligible to receive
health services in Alberta and for billing purposes. This type of health information includes the
following categories:

 • demographic information, including the individual’s personal health number;
 • location information;
 • telecommunications information;
 • residency information;
 • health services eligibility information; and
 • billing information, including an individual’s account number.

The specific elements of each of the above categories are set out in detail in section 3 of the
Health Information Regulation.

It is important for custodians not to disclose individually identifying registration information,
including account numbers without consent of the individuals who are the subjects of the
information, except for the purposes set out in section	36	(a),	(b)	or	(c)	and	sections	37.1
and	37.3.

“Registration	information”	only refers to recorded information. It does	not	include
information that is not written, photographed, recorded or stored in some manner in a record
(section	1(1)(u)).

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

 1.4.2

TO WHOM DOES THE HEALTH INFORMATION ACT APPLY?

The Act applies to “custodians”	of health information and to their “affiliates”.

A “custodian”	(section	1(1)(f))	includes:

 • the board of an approved hospital as defined in the Hospitals Act other than one that is
owned and operated by Alberta Health Services (e.g., a hospital operated by a voluntary
organization such as Covenant Health);

 • the operator of a nursing home as defined in the Nursing Homes Act other than a nursing
home that is owned and operated by Alberta Health Services (e.g., homes operated by
private or voluntary operators such as Extendicare (Canada) Inc. or the Good Samaritan
Society):

 • an ambulance operator as defined in the Emergency Health Services Act;
 • a provincial health board established by regulations under the Regional Health Authorities

Act (e.g., the Health Quality Council of Alberta );

 • a regional health authority established under the Regional Health Authorities Act (i.e.,

Alberta Health Services);

 • a community health council as defined in the Regional Health Authorities Act;
 • a subsidiary health corporation as defined in the Regional Health Authorities Act (e.g.,

Calgary Laboratory Services);

 • a board, council, committee, commission, panel or agency that is created by a custodian
listed above if all or a majority of its members are appointed by, or on behalf of that
custodian (e.g., a Hospital Services Utilization Committee)
(A committee under this provision does	not	include	a committee that has as its primary
purpose the carrying out of quality assurance activities within the meaning of section	9
of the Alberta Evidence Act. Quality assurance committees are appointed to study, assess
or evaluate the provision of health services with a view to continual improvement of the
quality of health care of the level of skill, knowledge and competence of health service
providers);

 • a health services provider who is designated in the regulations as a custodian;
 • a licensed pharmacy as defined in the Pharmacy and Drug Act;
 • the Department and the Minister; and
 • an individual or board, council, committee, commission, panel, agency, corporation or

other entity designated in the regulations as a custodian.

Section 2 of the Health Information Act Regulation (“HIAR”) designates certain health
professionals as custodians:

 • Regulated members of the Alberta College of Pharmacists;
 • Regulated members of the Alberta College of Optometrists;
 • Registered members of the Alberta Opticians Association;
 • Regulated members of the Alberta College and Association of Chiropractors;

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

 • Regulated members of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the Province of Alberta;
 • Registered members of the Alberta Association of Midwives;
 • Registered members of the Alberta Podiatry Association;
 • Regulated members of the College of Alberta Denturists;
 • Regulated members of the Alberta Dental Association and College (as of March 1, 2011):
 • Regulated members of the College of Registered Dental Hygienists of Alberta (as of

March 1, 2011); and

 • Regulated members of the College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta (as of

September 1, 2011).

Section 2 of the Health Information Regulation defines the following review or appeal panels as
custodians:

 • Claims Reassessment Advisory Committee;
 • Hospital Privileges Appeal Board;
 • Mental Health Patient Advocate;
 • Mental Health Review Panels in Calgary, Edmonton and Central Alberta;
 • MS Drug Review Panel;
 • Out-of-Country Health Services Committee;
 • Out-of-Country Health Services Appeal Panel; and
 • Alberta Rare Diseases Clinical Review Panel.

The definition of “custodian” does	not	include:

 • A Community Board or a Facility Board (P.D.D. Board) as those terms are defined in
the Persons with Developmental Disabilities Community Governance Act other than a
Community Board that is designated in the regulations as a custodian.

The same rationale for excluding P.D.D. Boards from the definition of “health service” applies
to the definition of “custodian”. See the discussion of these exclusions in the previous section
1.4.1. in this Chapter; See OIPC IR H2009-IR-003: In that case, the collection of immunization
records about a nurse by a custodian was to determine suitability for employment; that is,
for the primary purpose of managing or administering personnel. As such, the OIPC found
that no health service was provided in that context. The HIA does not apply when a health
service has not been provided. Therefore, the collection of this information in that case was
subject to FOIP, not HIA. Custodians must recognize they have dual roles. They are both health
services providers and employers. Custodians have access to Alberta Netcare as health services
providers. Netcare should not be used in the role of an employer to manage or administer
personnel. (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

An “affiliate” (section 1(1)(a)) includes:

 • an individual employed by a custodian;
 • a person who performs a service for the custodian as an appointee, volunteer or student or

under a contract or agency relationship with the custodian;

© 2006-2011  Government of Alberta

16

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

 • a health services provider who is exercising the right to admit and treat patients at a

hospital as defined in the Hospitals Act;

 • an information manager (as defined in section 66(1)), and
 • a person who is designated under the regulations to be an affiliate.

Section 2.1 of the Health Information Regulation enables a custodian to apply to the Minister
to be designated as an affiliate of another custodian. The custodian must first obtain written
consent from the other custodian. In deciding whether to permit a custodian to become an
affiliate of another custodian, the Minister is not required to hold a hearing. However, the
Minister must be satisfied the applicant custodian has sufficiently addressed the following
considerations:

 • the public interest;
 • the ability of the applicant to provide individuals with reasonable access to their personal

health information;

 • the ability of the applicant to comply with HIA; and
 • whether designating the applicant as an affiliate will improve the efficiency and

effectiveness of applying HIA.

An affiliate wishing to resume its duties as a custodian may do so by providing written notice
to the Minister and to the custodian to whom it was affiliated.

The rules for collection, use and disclosure of health information by custodians also apply to
their affiliates so custodians must ensure that their affiliates are aware of and follow the same
rules.

For example, when ABC Benefits Corporation acts as an agent of the Minister in providing non-
group supplementary health insurance plans on behalf of the Department, it is an “affiliate” of
the Minister subject to the terms and conditions of its contract with the Minister.

Private clinics or organizations that contract with a regional health authority (e.g., Gimbel Eye
Clinic) to provide health services would also be “affiliates”.

Health services providers such as physicians who have hospital admitting privileges with
Alberta Health Services are included in the definition of affiliate. Although a visiting or
consulting physician may not have admitting privileges at a hospital, he/she could still be an
“affiliate” if performing a service for the custodian under a contract or agency relationship
(section 1(1)(a)(ii)).

The definition of “affiliate” does not include:

 • an agent as defined in the Health Insurance Premiums Act; or
 • a health information repository other than a health information repository that is

designated in the regulations as an affiliate.

Under section	6,	custodians who collect, use or disclose health information pursuant	to
another enactment (such as the Public Health Act) are still bound to comply with the rules
under the Health Information Act in terms of that collection, use or disclosure.

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

 1.4.3  DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN REQUESTS FOR “HEALTH INFORMATION”

UNDER THE HEALTH INFORMATION ACT AND REQUESTS FOR “PERSONAL
INFORMATION” UNDER THE FOIP ACT

The definition of “record”	under the Health Information Act (section 1(1)(t)) is the same as the
definition of “record”	in the FOIP Act (section	1(1)(q)	of	that	Act).

A “record”	in both acts means a record of health information in any form and includes notes,
images, audiovisual recordings, x-rays, books, documents, maps, drawings, photographs,
letters, vouchers and papers and any other information that is written, photographed, recorded
or stored in any manner; but does not include software or any mechanism that produces
records (section 1(1)(t)).

However, section	4(1)(u)	of	the	FOIP Act says that the FOIP Act does not apply to health
information as defined in the Health Information Act that is in the custody or under the control
of a public body that is a “custodian”	as defined in the Health Information Act.

In the event that a custodian subject to both acts (such as Alberta Health and Wellness)
receives a request for access to an individual’s personal information, the rules regarding access
to information under the Health Information Act would apply to the individual’s “health
information”	as that is defined in the Health Information Act and the rules regarding access to
information under the FOIP Act would apply to the individual’s other “personal	information”
as that is defined in the FOIP Act.

For example, if a visitor to a hospital was injured during an incident involving a scuffle with
hospital security staff and was treated at that hospital, the visitor’s diagnostic, treatment and
care information as a patient of the hospital would be subject to the Health Information Act
access rules. However, any other personal information about the visitor, collected or created by
security staff as a result of the incident, would be subject to the FOIP Act access rules.

For	a	further	discussion	of	this,	see	section	2.4.6	of	Chapter	2	of	this	Publication.

 1.5

SCOPE OF THE HEALTH INFORMATION ACT

 1.5.1  WHAT THE HEALTH INFORMATION ACT DOES NOT APPLY TO

The	Act does	not	apply	to:

 • non-health	services	provided	by	a	custodian.
  Under Section	1(2),	where a “custodian” provides services that are not “health	services”
(as	defined	in	section	1(1)(m)), the Act does not apply to that custodian in respect of
those other services, nor to information relating to those other services.

18

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

 • other	processes	for	access	to	an	individual’s	own	health	information.
  The Health Information Act sets out a process for individuals to follow when they are

requesting access to, or correction or amendment of, their own health information (Part	2)
(Individual’s	Right	to	access	Individual’s	Health	Information). However, an individual is
not limited to the procedure set out in that Part to request access to the individual’s own
health information if another procedure is available, provided it complies with the Health
Information Act (see	section	2.3.1	in	Chapter	2	of	this	Publication	for	examples	of	other
processes).

  It is important to note that a person requesting access to another individual’s health

information would not make a request for access to health information under Part	2	of the
Act unless they were acting in a representative capacity under section	104.	If they were not
acting in a representative capacity for the individual, that kind of request would be subject
to the disclosure provisions of the Act under Part	5	(Disclosure	of	Health	Information).	See
the	discussion	of	this	under	section	2.3.3	Right	of	Access	Exercised	by	Other	Persons	in
Chapter	2	of	this	Publication.

 • collection	of	health	information	before	the	Act came into force.
	 Part	3	(Collection	of	Health	Information)	applies only in respect of health information

collected after the Act came into force. The parts of the Act dealing with use and disclosure
of health information apply retroactive to April 2001.

 1.5.2  OTHER MATTERS RELATED TO THE SCOPE OF THE ACT

The	Act does	not:

 • limit the information that would otherwise be available by law to a party to legal

proceedings (section	3(a)).	“Legal	proceedings”	are activities governed by the rules of
court or rules of judicial or quasi-judicial tribunals that can result in a judgment of a court
or a ruling by a tribunal in Canada.

  This means that the Act does not limit or prevent people from using legal processes such as

examinations for discovery to gather information about a party in a lawsuit.

 • affect the power of any court or tribunal in Canada to compel a witness to testify or to

compel the production of documents; and

 • prohibit the transfer, storage or destruction of a record in accordance with an enactment
of Alberta or Canada. An “enactment” under the Interpretation Act is defined as an Act
or regulation or any portion of an Act or regulation. This permits the orderly disposition
of records by custodians in accordance with records retention and disposition schedules
sanctioned by a law or regulation.

	 Section	108(1)(o)	authorizes the Lieutenant Governor in Council to make regulations
respecting the retention, disposal and archival storage of records for the purposes of
section	60	(Duty	to	Protect).	There are currently no regulations made under that section of
the Act. There are, however, other acts and regulations governing retention and disposition,
including the Operation of Approved Hospitals Regulation under the Hospitals Act and
Regulations under the Pharmaceutical Profession Act.

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

Treatment of non-recorded health information
The Act applies to the two categories of “health	information” in section	1(1)(k);	namely,
“diagnostic,	treatment	and	care	information”	(section	1(1)(i));	and	“registration	information”
(section	1(1)(u)). Those definitions specifically exclude information that is not written,
photographed, recorded or stored in some manner in a record. However, a custodian may only
use non-recorded (e.g., verbal) information for the purpose for which the information was
provided.

 1.6

INCONSISTENCY OR CONFLICT WITH ANOTHER ENACTMENT

Section 4 states that if a provision of the Health Information Act is inconsistent or in conflict
with a provision of another Act or regulation, the provisions of the Health Information Act
prevail unless

 • another act, or
 • a regulation under the Health Information Act expressly provides that the other act or

regulation, or a provision of it, prevails over the Health Information Act.

A conflict or inconsistency may occur when access to information in another act is more
restrictive than it is under the Health Information Act.

For example, section 75 of the Public Health Act will prevail over any enactment that it is in
conflict or inconsistent with, including the Health Information Act, except for the Alberta Bill of
Rights. A regulation under the Public Health Act prevails over any other by-law, rule, order or
regulation with which it conflicts.

Conversely, a conflict or inconsistency may occur when the rules regarding disclosure of health
information in the Health Information Act are more restrictive than a provision in another
act, such as the Child, Youth, and Family Enhancement Act Section 4(1). That Act requires
the reporting of information regarding a child in need of protection. Section 4 of the Health
Information Regulation expressly states that section 4 of that Act prevails despite the Health
Information Act.

On the other hand, a paramountcy provision is not needed where there is no conflict or
inconsistency between a provision of the Health Information Act and a provision in another act.

For example, if the right of a patient to obtain a copy of his or her medical records under the
Hospitals Act is the same as the right of access to those records under the Health Information Act,
there is no need to make one act prevail over the other. For another example, see OIPC Order
H2003-002 regarding the Public Health Act and the Health Information Act.

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

There are no paramountcy issues between the Health Information Act and the FOIP Act. Health
information in the custody or under the control of a public body (under the FOIP Act) that is
also a custodian (under the Health Information Act) has been carved out or excluded from
the FOIP Act (section	4(1)(p))	of the FOIP Act). The right of access provisions and rules for
collection, use, disclosure and protection of health information under the Health Information
Act will apply to health information in the custody or under the control of custodians that are
also public bodies.

See	OIPC	Order	H2004-001	&	F2004-005.	“Excerpt	[para	89]	The	effect	of	the	“HIA	carve
out”	is	that	in	situations	where	information	could	fall	under	either	HIA	or	FOIP,	FOIP	does
not	apply	where	the	information	is	properly	categorized	as	health	information	as	that	term
is	defined	in	HIA.	The	effect	of	the	“HIA	carve	out”	is	that	FOIP	ends	where	HIA	begins.”
(http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

Examples of other Paramountcies
As the Act is in force:

 • disclosure of health information under the Mental Health Act or the Hospitals Act is

subject to the relevant provisions of the Health Information Act so those statutes will no
longer be paramount over the Health Information Act.

 • section 21.1 of the Fatality Inquiries Act expressly prevails over the Health Information
Act to allow a medical examiner to inspect and make copies of any diagnosis, record or
information relating to a person receiving diagnostic and treatment services in a diagnostic
and treatment centre under the Mental Health Act or a patient under the Hospitals Act.

If there is a conflict or inconsistency between the Health Information Act and a provision of
another act or regulation and there is no specific provision in the enactment or in the Health
Information Regulation that states that the provision prevails over the Health Information
Act, then decisions about access and disclosure must be made in accordance with the Health
Information Act.

WHO AND WHAT IS SUBJECT TO THE HEALTH INFORMATION ACT?

Who is Subject to the Health Information Act?
The Health Information Act regulates individually identifying “health information”
that is collected, used, disclosed and created by “custodians”. It also provides some
regulation over non-custodians’ collection, use and disclosure of individually identifying
and non-identifying health information.

The Act applies to all individuals and organizations that are defined in the Act as
“custodians” and “affiliates” of custodians. This includes regional health authorities,
health service providers designated in the regulations as a custodian or who are within
a class of health service providers that is designated in the regulations, the Minister and
the Department.

The definitions of “custodian” and “affiliate” do not include everyone who may collect
or use health information in the course of their work. It also does not include other
provincial government departments and agencies, local public bodies such as schools,
post-secondary institutions and municipalities.

Who is a Custodian under the Health Information Act?
The Act defines the following individuals and organizations as “custodians”:

 • the Minister;
 • the Department;
 • Alberta Health Services (including the facilities operated by AHS);
 • Health Quality Council of Alberta;
 • hospitals not owned or operated by Alberta Health Services (e.g., not-for-profit

religious and voluntary hospitals);

 • nursing homes not owned or operated by health authorities (e.g., not-for-profit
religious and voluntary nursing homes and privately-owned for-profit nursing
homes);

 • community health councils of health authorities;
 • subsidiary health corporations established by health authorities;
 • boards, councils, committees, commissions, panels or agencies established by
a regional health authority, the Provincial Health Boards, voluntary hospitals,
voluntary or private nursing homes, community health councils and subsidiary
health corporations (Quality Assurance Committees per s.9 Alberta Evidence Act are
not custodians.);

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

 • a health services provider who has the right to admit and treat patients at a hospital

as defined in the Hospitals Act;
 • an information manager, and
 • a person who is designated under the regulations to be an affiliate.

Agents acting on the behalf of the Minister for the collection of health insurance
premiums (e.g., employers collect health insurance premiums) and a health information
repository other than a health information repository that is designated in the
regulations as an affiliate are excluded from the definition of “affiliate”.

Section 2.1 of the HIAR enables a custodian to apply to the Minister to be designated as
an affiliate of another custodian. The custodian must first obtain written consent from
the other custodian. In deciding whether to permit a custodian to become an affiliate of
another custodian, the Minister is not required to hold a hearing. However, the Minister
must be satisfied the applicant custodian has sufficiently addressed the following
considerations:

 • the public interest;
 • the ability of the applicant to provide individuals with reasonable access to their

personal health information;

 • the ability of the applicant to comply with HIA; and
 • whether designating the applicant as an affiliate will improve the efficiency and

effectiveness of applying HIA.

An affiliate wishing to resume its duties as a custodian may do so by providing written
notice to the Minister and to the custodian to whom it was affiliated.

What Information is Regulated under the Health Information Act?
Health information is regulated under the Act. “Health	information” is defined as
the following recorded information about individuals: diagnostic, treatment and care
information and registration information. The reference to “recorded” is significant.
The Act primarily regulates tangible records of information and not “non-recorded
information”. The Act, however, contains a few basic provisions to maintain the
confidentiality of health information that is not recorded.

Diagnostic,	Treatment	and	Care	Information includes the following:

the physical and mental health of an individual;

(i)
(ii)  a health service provided to an individual;
(iii)  the donation by an individual of a body part or bodily substance, including
information derived from the testing or examination of a body part or
bodily substance;

(iv)  a drug as defined in the Pharmacy and Drug Act provided to an individual;

CHAPTER ONE – Introduction

(v)  a health care aid, device, product, equipment or other item provided to an

individual pursuant to a prescription or other authorization; and

(vi)  the amount of any benefit paid or payable under the Alberta Health Care
Insurance Act or any other amount paid or payable in respect of a health
service provided to an individual;

and includes any other information about an individual that is collected when a health
service is provided to the individual but does not include non-recorded information.

Registration	Information includes information within the following general categories
and is more specifically described in section 3 of the Health Information Regulation:

(i)  demographic information (e.g., name, signature, personal health number,
photograph, gender, date of birth, birth information, marital status, date
of death, treaty status and whether the individual is a registrant or a
dependant of a registrant under the Health Insurance Premiums Act);
(ii)  location, residency and telecommunications information (e.g., home,
business and mailing addresses, electronic address; health region;
citizenship or immigration status; date of entry into Canada; province
or country of birth or last residence; date of permanent residency; in the
event a registrant or dependant under the Health Insurance Premiums
Act is going to be absent from Alberta, such things as date of departure,
forwarding address, etc.; and health service eligibility information); and
(iii)  billing information (e.g., information about amounts owed, method of

payment, individual’s account number);

but does not include non-recorded information.

Non-identifying	Health	Information means that the identity of the individual who is the
subject of the information cannot be readily ascertained from the information. The Act
regulates information that identifies individuals. Non-identifying information includes
statistical information about groups of individuals and individual information that is
collected, used, and disclosed in a way that makes it anonymous. The Act contains a
few basic provisions restricting the use of non-identifiable information.

This Chapter will cover:

 • how an individual can exercise the right of access to his or her own health information;
 • how the right of access can be exercised by other authorized persons, on behalf of the

individual;

 • how a custodian should respond to a request for access to health information;
 • how a custodian should administer the request process; and
 • how a custodian may deal with abandoned requests.

 2.2

HOW DO CUSTODIANS THAT ARE ALSO PUBLIC BODIES UNDER THE FOIP ACT
DEAL WITH ACCESS REQUESTS?

Custodians subject to both acts need to be able to distinguish between requests for “health
information” under the Health Information Act and requests for “personal information” under
the FOIP Act.

In the event that a custodian subject to both acts receives a request for access to an individual’s
personal information, the rules regarding access to information under the Health Information
Act would apply to the individual’s “health information” as that is defined in the Health
Information Act and the rules regarding access to information under the FOIP Act would apply
to the individual’s other “personal information” as that is defined in the FOIP Act.

For example, if a visitor to a hospital was injured during an incident involving a scuffle with
hospital security staff and was treated at that hospital, the visitor’s diagnostic, treatment and
care information as a patient of the hospital would be subject to the Health Information Act
access rules. However, any other personal information about the visitor, collected or created by
security staff as a result of the incident, would be subject to the FOIP Act access rules.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

“Personal information” is defined in section 1(1)(n) of the FOIP Act as recorded information
about an identifiable individual, including

(i)

the individual’s name, home or business address or home or business
telephone number,

(ii)  the individual’s race, national or ethnic origin, colour or religious or political

beliefs or associations,

(iii)  the individual’s age, sex, marital status or family status,
(iv)  an identifying number, symbol or other particular assigned to the individual,
(v)  the individual’s fingerprints, other biometric information, blood type, genetic

information or inheritable characteristics,

(vi)  information about the individual’s health and health care history, including

information about a physical or mental disability,

(vii) information about the individual’s educational, financial, employment or criminal

history, including criminal records where a pardon has been given,

(viii) anyone else’s opinions about the individual, and
(ix)  the individual’s personal views or opinions, except if they are about someone else.

The definition in section 1(n)(vi) includes information that would be considered “health
information” under the Health Information Act.

“Health information” is defined in section 1(1)(k) of the Act as “diagnostic, treatment and
care information”; and “registration information” as those terms are defined in the Act.

Note that the definition of “record” under the FOIP Act also includes “notes, images,
audiovisual recordings and x-rays”.

For a more detailed explanation of “health information” refer to section 1.4.1 in Chapter 1 of
this Publication.

For a further discussion on how to deal with access requests if you are a custodian subject to
both acts see section 1.4.3 in Chapter 1 of this Publication.

EXAMPLE: HIA AND FOIP REQUEST

OIPC Order H2005-004

The Applicant made a series of requests to the regional health authority (the Custodian) for
his health records and records relating to his involvement with a clinic operated by the health
region. He was provided with many pages of his records, but noticed that a questionnaire
he had filled out was not included. The Custodian did not include the questionnaire because
they considered it “raw data” that was not in the Applicant’s medical record. The Applicant
later complained to the Privacy Commissioner who found the custodian’s explanation to be
reasonable. However, Section 16 of the Health Information Act imposes a duty on a custodian
to provide requested information if it is considered personal information under the Freedom
of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, and does not fall within the definition of health

information in the Health Information Act. A request under section 8(1) of the Health Information
Act for access to a record that contains information to which FOIP applies is considered a
deemed request under section 7(1) of FOIP. The information to which FOIP applies must be
handled in accordance with the FOIP Act.

A custodian must have regard to its own practices about where health information might be
found. If it is possible there are records that are not kept in medical files the search must extend
to those other locations. (See OIPC Order H2005-004 http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

 2.3

HOW DOES AN INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO THE
INDIVIDUAL’S OWN HEALTH INFORMATION?

Under section 7(1), an individual has the right to access any record containing health
information about the individual that is in the custody or under the control of a custodian.

This is similar to the right of access to information under the Freedom of Information and
Protection of Privacy (FOIP) Act but, unlike the FOIP Act, the right only extends to health
information about the individual and can only be exercised by the individual or the individual’s
representative (see section 104). The right of access under section 7(1) does not extend to
someone other than the individual or the individual’s representative.

To determine whether records are subject to the Health Information Act for the purposes of
section 7(1), it is not necessary for a custodian to have both custody and control of a record
containing health information. There may be situations where a custodian has custody but not
control of a record or vice versa.

See OIPC Orders F2002-006, F2000-021, 2000-005 F2000-003, and F1999-032 for discussion of
this issue.

“Custody” means having possession of the health information or record containing health
information and having the right to deal with the record or information.

“Control” means that a custodian has the authority to manage the health information or the
record containing health information in ways such as restricting, regulating and administering
its use, disclosure or disposition.

Some indicators that a record may be in the custody or under the control of a custodian were
set out in OIPC Order 99-032 and referred to in OIPC Order 2000-05. The indicators mentioned
in those orders were:

 • the records were created by an officer or an employee of the public body (that is, an

affiliate of the custodian), including an outside contracted consultant of the custodian;

 • the records were specified in a contract as being under the control of a public body

(custodian);

 • the records were in the custody of the public body (custodian);

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 • the records were integrated with other records of the public body (custodian);
 • the records related to the public body’s (custodian’s) mandate and functions;
 • there were regulations regarding the use and disposition of the records; and
 • the public body (custodian) has relied on the records to a great extent.

OIPC Order 2000-05 involved a request to access records relating to a regional health authority
and its partnership with a laboratory services company. The Commissioner found that although
the regional health authority did not have control over the financial statements, contracts and
other agreements related to the laboratory services company, the health authority did have
possession, and therefore, custody, of the records. The records in question were therefore
subject to the FOIP Act.

The most common situation where a custodian may have control, but not custody, of health
information is in the case of contracted services. The information or record is created by and
in the possession of the contractor, but the custodian has set out some rights of access to the
records in its contract. For example, the contractor would have to furnish the custodian with
information and particulars concerning the services provided and the care and progress of
persons receiving the services.

Note that when a custodian hires a contractor to provide health services or handle health
information, the custodian still has a duty to protect the health information that is handled
by the contractor, and that is in the contractor’s custody or control. Under section 1(1)(a) of
the Health Information Act, the contractor would be considered an affiliate of the custodian.
The custodian must establish its own policies and procedures to comply with the Health
Information Act, and must ensure its affiliates, including contractors, are aware of the custodian’s
obligations regarding the Health Information Act and the custodian’s expectations for complying
with the Act. The custodian could impose conditions on the contractor, or could require
certain physical, administrative and technical safeguards be in place, or the custodian could
require the contractor to establish its own policies and procedures regarding the handling
of health information. The custodian could also require that all employees of the contractor
attend Health Information Act training. Ultimately it is the custodian who is responsible for
ensuring compliance with the Health Information Act, and contractors must be made aware of
their responsibility to comply with the Act. See OIPC Investigation Reports H2002-001 and
H2001-IR-009 for discussion of the responsibilities of the custodian and affiliate in a contract
relationship. (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 2.3.1

EXISTING PROCEDURES STILL AVAILABLE

As in the FOIP Act, under section 17 of the Health Information Act, if a custodian has another
procedure available for individuals to access their own health information in certain situations,
the individual may choose the existing process to access the information. This would allow for
access without the formality and administrative expense of making a request under the Act.
The custodian still has the obligation to review the health information before providing it to
the individual to ensure that none of the exceptions to right of access apply (see section 11 of
the Act, and Chapter 3 of this publication for information on exceptions to the right of access).
If any exceptions apply, the custodian should handle the request as a formal request for access
under the Health Information Act.

The procedure set out in Part 2 of the Act (Individual’s Right to Access Individual’s Health
Information) may be used by individuals who have not been able to use existing procedures
or who have not been satisfied with the amount or kind of information they have received
through those procedures. There may be situations where confidence, trust or communication
has broken down and individuals may prefer to request access to their health records
using the process outlined in the Act and with the right of appeal to the Information and
Privacy Commissioner.

The Act does not limit the information that would otherwise be available by law to a party to
a legal proceeding (section 3(a)). This means that the Act does not prevent or limit the use
of legal processes such as examination for discovery to gather information about a party in
a lawsuit.

For example, a person may make a request to a custodian for health records relating to
an individual involved in a civil or criminal legal action. If a lawyer is the authorized
representative of an individual (section 104) and requests access to that individual’s own
health information, the request would be dealt with as a request under section 7(1). If a
lawyer requests access to health information about someone other than his or her client, the
request would be treated as a request for disclosure under Part 5 of the Act (Disclosure of
Health Information).

Once a legal action proceeds to discovery, or if some other legal procedure is invoked to obtain
disclosure of records, the rules governing that legal procedure will apply. The access provisions
of the Health Information Act apply only to requests made under Part 2 of the Act (Individual’s
Right to Access Individual’s Health Information) and not to other legal processes, although
both processes may be happening at the same time.

The provisions of the Act do not override the power of any court or tribunal in Canada to
compel a witness to testify or to compel the production of documents (section 3(b)).

Section 35(1)(i) facilitates those processes by permitting the disclosure of individually
identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information for the purpose of complying with a
subpoena, warrant or court order.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

Note that the Fee Schedule in the Health Information Regulation does not apply to disclosures
of health information under Part 5 of the Act (Disclosure of Health Information), such as
disclosures to third parties like insurance companies. Custodians may charge their own fees for
these services, for instance when a clinician has to create a new record, or when records are
copied and provided to third parties that are not custodians.

See Chapter 8 of this Publication for a more detailed discussion of the disclosure provisions of
Health Information Act.

The right of access extends to all health information that is in the custody or under the control
of the custodian, regardless of who created it or where it came from. For example, a health
record containing health information created by a non-custodian that is in the custodian’s files
would potentially be accessible under the Health Information Act.

Example
OIPC Order F2004-005 and H2004-001 deals with an access request by an individual who
requested all information in his file from the regional health authority. Some of the records that
were in the file were records that were created by health services providers outside of Alberta.
There were also records from the justice, law enforcement, corrections, and legal systems. Many
of these records were all provided, however some information was severed from the records
due to exceptions to right of access in the Health Information Act.

There are some exceptions to the right of access set out in section 11 (See Chapter 3 of this
Publication). The right of access to a health record is subject to the payment of any fee
required by the regulations (section 7(3)) and any severing that may have to occur if any of the
exceptions apply to the requested information.

 2.3.2  NATURE AND FORM OF REQUEST

The provisions in the Health Information Act regarding the nature of a request are similar to
those in the FOIP Act. Section 8(1) provides that an individual must make a request for access
to the custodian that the individual believes has custody or control of the record.

Section 8(2) says that a custodian that has received a request for access to a record may
require the applicant to submit the request in writing. This is different from the FOIP Act
which requires all access requests to be in writing although there are provisions in the FOIP
Regulation allowing applicants to make oral requests in certain circumstances.

An “applicant” is defined in section 1(1)(b) as the individual who makes a request for access
under section 8(1) or a request for correction under section 13(1). An “applicant” is also
an individual who makes a request for access to a record of notations of disclosure when
the individual is the subject of that information (section 41(3)). An “applicant” is also an
authorized representative of an individual (section 104) who makes a request for access or a
request for a correction or amendment on behalf of the individual.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

Custodians in small offices may decide to accept oral access requests. In order to manage the
request process, larger custodians may require requests to be written. The exception may be
for an applicant who cannot make a written request due to a language barrier or physical
disability. However, custodians must still ensure that they deal with the access request in
accordance with sections 10, 11, 12, 15 and 16.

Where a custodian requires requests to be submitted in writing, an applicant can use the
Request To Access An Individual’s Own Health Information Form found in Appendix 1 of this
Publication or can simply write a letter requesting his or her own health information.

BEST PRACTICE: Although a custodian may accept an oral request, if the custodian is large or
decentralized, and especially if it is subject to both the FOIP Act and the Health Information Act,
it would be better to require that all requests under section 7(1) be submitted in writing. This will
enable the custodian to establish the starting date for the response time, provide clarity regarding
the scope of the request and facilitate a request for records subject to the FOIP Act, if that Act applies
to a portion of the request.

Custodians should establish policies and procedures to deal with the acceptance of written and/or
oral requests. The policies and procedures should address, among other things, the starting date for
the response period. If the request is oral, it still needs to be documented and dated.

Applicants may ask to either examine the record requested or to obtain a copy of it
(Section 8(3)).

 2.3.3

RIGHT OF ACCESS EXERCISED BY AN INDIVIDUAL OR BY THE INDIVIDUAL’S
AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE

Section 104(1) states that any right or power conferred on an individual by this Act may be
exercised by the following persons in certain circumstances. These rights or powers include the
right to access an individual’s own health information.

By the Individual Aged 18 or Over
(Section 104(1)(a))
An individual who is 18 years of age or older may exercise his or her own rights or powers
under the Act.

By a Mature Minor
(Section 104(1)(b))
Individuals under 18 years of age will, in some cases, exercise their own rights or powers under
the Act. Where a minor understands the nature of the right or power and the consequences of
exercising the right or power, he or she may exercise that right or power.

This provision leaves discretion in the hands of the custodian. Custodians should have a policy
and procedure for dealing with minors based on the statutes and regulations under which
they operate.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

For example, some factors to consider when deciding if a youth might emotionally and
intellectually have the capacity to give consent are: maturity; economic status (i.e.,
self-supporting or not); living arrangements; mental state; risk assessment; and the complexity
and intrusiveness of the treatment situation and treatment modality.

Similar factors might be helpful in determining whether a youth has the capacity to exercise
the right of access to his or her own health information. The fact that a 14 year old girl seeks
health care on her own may lead a custodian to believe that the girl might be considered a
mature minor.

Note, however, that the opinions and views of the minor are just one of the factors that
must be taken into account in making a decision about who may exercise access rights. The
custodian will also have to consider the context of each request to determine whether the right
of access may be exercised by the minor or by a guardian.

In Order F2005-017 and H2005-001 the Privacy Commissioner stated that factors that must be
regarded to determine whether a person under 18 is a mature minor is the individual’s age,
maturity, independence, level of understanding, and the nature and complexity of the HIA
rights or powers. It was indicated that the level of understanding required for an individual
to understand the nature and consequences of exercising rights or powers under HIA is not a
particularly onerous standard.

Note that this category is not included in the FOIP Act.

Example – Where the Wishes of a Guardian Conflict with the Wishes of a Mature Minor

In OIPC Order F2005-017 and H2005-001 the Privacy Commissioner ruled that a mother (the
applicant) did not have the authority to exercise her daughter’s rights or powers under the
Health Information Act. The applicant did not provide any evidence to indicate that her daughter
did not understand the nature and the consequences of exercising her own rights or powers
under the Act. The Privacy Commissioner examined the records for evidence indicating whether
or not the daughter was capable of understanding the nature of her rights or powers and the
consequences of exercising her rights or powers under the Act. In this case, the daughter was
15 ½ at the time of the access request and had been living independently from her mother for
over two years. Her records from two years previous to the access request indicated that she
had reasonable comprehension for her age, was a good student and an independent thinker.
The custodian, a regional health authority, had provided a letter to the applicant (the mother
of the individual) describing the daughter as a “mature minor” who could consent to and
control release of her patient record, and that the daughter would need to be involved in any
decisions about her hospital records. Based on the evidence of the daughter’s understanding
and the applicant’s failure to discharge the burden of proof to show that her daughter lacked
understanding of the nature and consequences of exercising her own rights or powers under
the Health Information Act, the Privacy Commissioner found that the mother did not have
authority to exercise the rights or powers of her minor daughter. (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

By a Guardian of the Minor
(Section 104(1)(c))
If an individual is under 18 years of age and the custodian determines that the individual does
not understand the right or power and/or the consequences of exercising that right or power,
the guardian must exercise the right or power.

A “guardian” is a person who is legally responsible for the care and custody of the minor.
This definition may not extend to the biological parents of a child in all circumstances. Other
guardians may be a child’s grandparent or other relative, the Director of Child, Youth, and
Family Enhancement or other individual who has been granted a guardianship order by
the Court.

Usually when a custodian refuses access to all or part of a record to the individual, the
custodian has the burden of proof to show that the applicant has no right of access to the
record. The exception is when an applicant is purporting to exercise another individual’s rights
or powers. If the applicant is a guardian exercising the right or power of his or her son or
daughter who is under the age of 18, the guardian must show that his or her son or daughter
does not understand the nature of the right or power and the consequences of exercising the
right or power. This will clearly be the case where the applicant is exercising rights on behalf
of an infant or young child. Where it is less clear, the custodian will need to first determine
whether or not the child is a mature minor before considering the guardian’s request. The
mature minor assessment may require consultation with another custodian.

In OIPC Order F2005-017 and H2005-001, the applicant wanted access to her teenage
daughter’s psychological questionnaire results. It was a psychologist with the health region
who wrote a letter to the mother stating that the daughter was a “mature minor” and would
therefore need to be involved in any decisions about her hospital records.

By a Personal Representative of a Deceased Individual Over 18 Years (Section 104(1)(d))
If the individual is deceased and was 18 years of age or over immediately before death, the
individual’s personal representative (e.g., executor or administrator of the individual’s estate)
can exercise the right of access or other right or power of the individual under the Act.

However, the personal representative’s right is limited to requesting health information or
records that relate to the administration of the individual’s estate. For instance, information
in the individual’s medical records at a physician’s office about the individual’s health prior
to death may be needed to assist the executor in a legal action related to the death and to the
settlement of the estate.

Proof of the right to act on behalf of the deceased is normally a copy of the signed and attested
document or a court document naming the representative to act in matters related to the
estate. This would include, for example, a properly executed will or Letters of Administration
from a court. Evidence that would not be sufficient would be an applicant’s stated belief in his
or her authority, whether by affidavit or statutory declaration, or evidence that an applicant
administered the individual’s estate in the past. See OIPC Order 98-004 http://www.oipc.ab.ca

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

The right of access for an individual who was under the age of 18 immediately before death
would be exercised by the individual’s guardian (as in section 104(1)(c)).

For information related to disclosure of health information to relatives of deceased persons, see
Sections 8.5.5, 8.5.6 and 8.5.16 in Chapter 8 of this Publication.

By a Guardian or Trustee Under the Adult Guardianship and Trusteeship Act
(Section 104(1)(e))
If a guardian or trustee has been appointed for the individual under the Adult Guardianship
and Trusteeship Act, the guardian or trustee may exercise the individual’s rights provided the
information requested relates to the powers or duties of the guardian or trustee. A trustee may
need to access the results of certain tests conducted on a dependant adult to provide some
evidence in court of the need to renew or terminate the guardianship order.

The document governing the nature of the guardianship or trusteeship provides the authority
for the representative to act. Custodians should examine that document to ensure that the
disclosure relates to the powers and duties stipulated in the document.

By an Agent of the Individual Under the Personal Directives Act
(Section 104(1)(f))
If an agent has been designated under the Personal Directives Act, the agent can exercise the
individual’s rights. The disclosure is limited to the rights or powers given to the agent under
the personal directive. Personal directives cannot provide authority over financial matters.

Custodians should examine the directive before disclosure. It may be necessary to access
information about the capacity of the individual who made the directive or about the decision
to be made by the agent in order to determine what information may be disclosed.

By an Individual Granted a Power of Attorney
(Section 104(1)(g))
A power of attorney is an authority given to one person (called the attorney) to do certain acts
in the name of, and personally representing, the person granting the power (called the donor).
A power of attorney can enable the attorney to perform specific actions on behalf of the donor
or it can be a general power of attorney to do everything that the donor can do. Some powers
of attorney can be revoked by the donor. Some are irrevocable.

Some powers of attorney come into effect in the event of mental incapacity (e.g., an enduring
power of attorney). Some remain in effect in the event of the mental incapacity of the donor,
provided they comply with the provisions of the Powers of Attorney Act. The death of a donor
normally revokes the power of attorney.

The exercise of the right or power under the Health Information Act must relate to the powers
and duties conferred by the power of attorney. Information about the donor’s physical or
mental health may need to be accessed in order to determine whether a specified contingency
has occurred that will bring the power of attorney into effect.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

When the rights or powers conferred by the Act on an individual are to be exercised by
someone holding a power of attorney, the custodian should verify the identity of the person
holding the power of attorney and ensure that the power allows for the disclosure requested or
any other power or right being invoked.

It may also be necessary, depending on the nature of the power of attorney, to verify that the
donor is alive or that the donor is not suffering from a mental incapacity.

By the Nearest Relative of a Formal Patient under the Mental Health Act
(Section 104(1)(h))
The “nearest relative” of a “formal patient” as defined in section 1(1)(e) of the Mental Health
Act may exercise the right of access of an individual if the exercise of the right or power is
necessary to carry out the obligations of the nearest relative under that Act.

A “formal patient” under the Mental Health Act means a patient detained in a facility on
the basis of 2 admission certificates or 2 renewal certificates. “Nearest relative” is defined in
section 1(i) of that Act.

For certified (or formal) patients of various psychiatric facilities such as Alberta Hospital
Edmonton, Centennial Centre for Mental Health and Brain Injury and, Claresholm Centre for
Mental Health and Addictions or of hospital psychiatric wards at, for example, the University of
Alberta Hospital or Foothills Medical Centre, who do not have a legal representative or agent,
the nearest relative may make specified decisions in the patient’s best interest.

Note that this category of representative is not included in the FOIP Act.

By Any Person with the Individual’s Written Authorization
(Section 104(1)(i))
Any individual can provide authorization to another person to act on his or her behalf. Such
authorization must be in writing, and can provide authority to the representative to exercise
any right or undertake any power, including the right to provide consent under various
provisions of the Act, or simply the right to access the individual’s health information.

The authorization must be signed by the individual, and preferably witnessed. An example of
an Authorization of Representative Form is included in Appendix 1 of this Publication.

Notices (Section 104(2))
This section provides that any notice required to be given to an individual under the Act may
be given to the person entitled to exercise the individual’s rights and powers referred to in
section 104(1).

 2.3.4

RIGHT OF ACCESS TO DISCLOSURE INFORMATION

Section 41 requires that custodians make a notation when they disclose without consent,
records that contain individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information.
This notation must include the name of the person to whom the custodian disclosed the
information, the date and purpose of the disclosure, and a description of the information that
has been disclosed.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

This requirement is not applicable when a custodian allows other custodians electronic
access to individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information stored in a
database, provided that, when the information is disclosed, the database automatically keeps
an electronic log of a name or number that identifies the custodian to whom the information
is disclosed, the date and time that the information is disclosed and a description of the
information that is disclosed (section 41(1.1.))

Section 6 of the HIA Electronic Health Record Regulation requires custodians to ensure
their electronic health record information systems have capacity to create and maintain logs
containing the following information:

 • user identification and application identification associated with an access;
 • name of user and application that performs an access;
 • role or job functions of user who performs an access;
 • date of an access;
 • time of an access;
 • actions performed by a user during an access, including, without limitation, creating,

viewing, editing and deleting information;

 • name of facility or organization at which an access is performed;
 • display screen number or reference;
 • personal health number of the individual in respect of whom an access is performed;
 • name of the individual in respect of whom an access is performed;
 • any other information required by the Minister.

This section applies only to electronic health information systems established after the coming
into force of this Regulation.

An individual who is the subject of the information has the right to ask a custodian for
access to such disclosure notations and for a copy of the information (section 41(3)). Part 2
(Individual’s Right of Access to Individual’s Health Information) applies to the request.
Accessing this type of information does not have to be done by way of a separate request.
Since disclosure notations would be placed on a patient’s health record or be retrievable in a
disclosure log by individual identifier, the information could be released to the individual as
part of a request for access to all of their health information. Alternatively, if the disclosure
notation is the only subject of the request, it could be processed as a separate request.
Individuals have a right to request access to, or a copy of, a record of disclosures of their
diagnostic, treatment and care information from a computer database the same way they have
a right to request access to, or a copy of, a record of disclosures from a health record in a hard
copy or paper file.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 2.4

HOW SHOULD A CUSTODIAN RESPOND TO AN INDIVIDUAL’S REQUEST
FOR ACCESS TO THE INDIVIDUAL’S HEALTH INFORMATION?

 2.4.1  DUTY TO ASSIST APPLICANTS

Section 10(a) expresses the duty of a custodian to make every reasonable effort to assist an
applicant and to respond to each applicant openly, accurately and completely.

This means that if the applicant is not fully knowledgeable as to what records may exist or how
they are organized, for example, the custodian has a duty to tell the applicant what they need
to know in order for them to obtain as much of the information they are seeking as possible
under the Act.

If there is an indication on an individual’s health record that another custodian may also have
health information about the individual, as part of the duty to assist, applicants should be
advised that another custodian or other organization may have health information about them
and that they may make a separate request to that custodian or organization.

This is an important duty to keep in mind throughout the request process. It is critical during
the applicant’s initial contact with a custodian. The Health Information Coordinator or person
handling access requests under the Act should attempt to develop a working relationship with
the applicant to define the nature and scope of the request and to determine the steps involved
in processing the request.

Example of Duty to Assist

In Order H2006-003 the applicant said that the regional health authority had breached its
duty to assist and failed to conduct an adequate search for records. In the first of two access
requests the custodian severed the registration numbers for two ambulance attendants,
citing the reason that it was information about someone other than the individual. After
the applicant appealed to the OIPC, there was mediation with the result that the custodian
decided to disclose the records. The applicant argued that by improperly severing information,
the custodian failed to respond openly, accurately and completely. The approach taken in
previous orders (H2005-007, H2005-006, F2004-005 and H2004-001) established that other
duties in HIA are not linked to the duty to assist unless those duties are expressly linked by
the legislation.

The applicant claimed that the custodian did not direct her to the information that was severed,
and that the custodian did not number the pages in sequence.

The OIPC found that the custodian did, in fact, meet its duty to assist the applicant. The severed
section was indicated on the first page of the record that was provided to the applicant.
The applicant did not request the pages be numbered, and did not contact the custodian to
inquire about the page numbering or severing of information even though the phone number
for the custodian was provided indicating the applicant could contact them if she had any

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

questions. The OIPC pointed out that a custodian cannot know what an applicant wants unless
the applicant tells the custodian. Furthermore, the applicant was provided with the severed
information after mediation, and was never charged for the second access request, even though
897 pages were copied and provided to her.

OIPC Orders H2005-007, H2005-006, F2004-005 and H2004-001 also discuss the custodian’s
duty to assist the applicant. (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

The standard the custodian must meet to respond openly, accurately and completely is not a
standard of perfection, but rather what is reasonable for a custodian to do in order to assist the
applicant who is making an access request.

 2.4.2

CREATING A NEW RECORD

Under section 10(b), a custodian has an obligation to create a new record from an existing
electronic record if:

 • the record is in the custody or under the control of the custodian;
 • the new record can be created using the custodian’s normal computer hardware and

software and technical expertise; and

 • creating the record would not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the custodian.

This is the only case where the legislation requires a custodian to create a new record.
A custodian would be required to do this if health information is stored in electronic or
machine readable form and they need to create a human readable report or extract..

It is part of the custodian’s duty to assist the applicant in locating the information which is the
most useful and responsive to the request. The creation of a new record from manipulative data
can be a considerable advantage to custodians in some instances. Information that is excepted
from the record can sometimes be suppressed, saving long and tedious severing procedures.

The custodian should explain the methods used and what information is being suppressed so
that the applicant does not think that information is being manipulated to alter the record or
place a different perspective on it. Custodians should also take reasonable steps to ensure the
information is accurate, which is one of their duties under the Act (see OIPC Order 99-014, and
section 61 of the Health Information Act).

The provision is mandatory but extends only to the situation where the record can be created
using its normal staff, equipment and software products, and where doing so would not
unreasonably displace the business related data processing jobs necessary for the custodian
to complete.

In determining whether creation of a record would unreasonably interfere with the custodian’s
operations, the person responsible for responding to the request should consult with both the
medical records or other area that has the records as well as the information technology area
to assess the time and resources which would be required to create the record and the impact
which this use of resources would have on its day-to-day activities.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

In addition to providing the record, under section 10(c), the custodian must provide, at
the applicant’s request, and if reasonably practicable, an explanation of any term, code or
abbreviation used in the record.

The duty to assist an applicant is limited by what is “reasonably practicable”. A custodian
cannot be expected to fulfill this duty if the record was created by another custodian.
A physician may not be able to personally provide an explanation. However, a health
record technician or office nurse or other support person may be able to provide the
assistance needed.

This section does not include an obligation to provide an explanation of the meaning or
impact of the information contained in the records regarding the current or future health of the
individual. However, if some of the information is illegible, the custodian should try to obtain
a medical transcription of the information in the record or ask the health services provider to
make the information legible before providing it to the applicant (see OIPC Order 98-002 – re
illegible clinical notes as part of a Workers’ Compensation Board claimant’s access request).

 2.4.3

TIME LIMIT FOR RESPONDING TO A REQUEST

Section 12(1) provides that a custodian must make every reasonable effort to respond to
a request within 30 days after receiving the request or within any extended period under
section 15. In response to an applicant’s request, the custodian must inform the individual
whether access to a record or part of it will be granted to them, and when and how that access
will be given. If access is denied, the custodian must provide the reasons for the refusal and
point to provisions in the Act which justify the denial, as well as the name, title, business
address and business telephone number of an affiliate of the custodian who can answer the
applicant’s questions about the refusal. Further, the custodian must also inform the applicant
that they can ask for a review of the decision from the Office of the Information and Privacy
Commissioner (section 12(2)).

The 30 day limit is based on calendar days. The time period begins on the date the request
is received in an office duly authorized to deal with it and, if applicable, any fee is paid.
The short time period in which the Act requires a request to be processed emphasizes the
usefulness of having a written request so that the starting date is clear.

If the request is incomplete and further information is required from the applicant, custodians
should seek this information immediately. Such clarification does not alter the official date
of receipt of the request. However, the need to seek more information may be grounds for
extending the time limit.

Deemed Refusal
Section 12(3) clearly establishes that the failure of a custodian to respond to a request within
the 30 day period or any extended period, is to be treated as a decision to refuse access to the
particular record(s). Such action qualifies the request for complaint and review. In this case,
the time limit for requesting a review by the Commissioner, under section 74(2), does not
apply (section 74(3)).

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 2.4.4

EXTENDING TIME LIMIT

Section 15(1) sets out the only circumstances in which a custodian may extend the time limit
for responding:

 • where the request is vaguely worded or the record is impossible to locate without

clarification from the applicant;

 • where the search or review of a particularly large volume of records necessitates a longer
response time and would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the custodian; and
 • where the custodian consults with other custodians before deciding whether or not to grant

access and cannot respond to the request within the time limit.

A custodian should consider all factors relating to the possibility of the need for a time
extension before deciding to invoke one. Common factors include:

 • the amount and type of detail needed from the applicant to clarify the request;
 • the breadth and complexity of the request, the number of records requested and the

number of files or sites which must be searched to find the requested records;

 • the number and complexity of consultations required with other custodians or levels of

government; and

 • the quantity and type of records requiring review by other custodians.

If the response time is extended, the custodian must inform the applicant of why an extension
was necessary, when the applicant can expect to receive a response and that the applicant may
make a complaint to the Commissioner about the extension (section 15(2)).

Limits on Extensions
Custodians should make every effort to plan the processing of complicated requests so that
there is a need to invoke only one extension. A custodian may, on its own authority and within
the original 30 day time limit, extend the 30 day limit for up to 30 days, for a maximum of
60 calendar days. The custodian can extend the time period for responding to a request from
an applicant for an additional period of up to 30 days or longer or for a longer period with
the consent of the Commissioner if: the request does not provide sufficient information to
allow the custodian to positively identify the record requested; many records are involved in
the request and responding within the 30 day period would unreasonably interfere with the
operations of the custodian; or more time is required to consult with another custodian before
the decision to grant access to a record is made, or to make an amendment or correction to a
record (section 15(1)).

If a custodian believes that responding to the request will require more than a total of 60 days,
it is required to ask the Information and Privacy Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) for
permission to extend the time limit beyond the original 30 days. This must be done in writing
and normally within the original 30 day time limit.

A letter to the Commissioner requesting the extension should set out the specific conditions
relating to the request which will necessitate a period greater than 60 days for its processing
and establish a reasonable period (e.g., 90 days) for producing a response.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

In exceptional circumstances, a custodian who has already taken a 30 day extension, may
seek a second extension from the Commissioner. This might occur when the relevant
records suddenly involve complications not originally contemplated when planning the
response process.

Where the Commissioner refuses to grant permission for an extension, the custodian has only
a maximum of 60 days to process the request. Custodians must continue to process a request
while awaiting the Commissioner’s response to an extension request.

Custodians must document the reasons for a time limit extension. This is required to support
the custodian’s decision to extend, for a request to the Commissioner for an extension of more
than 30 days, and in the case of a complaint by the applicant to the Commissioner.

Notification
Section 15(2) requires the custodian to notify the applicant that an extension is being taken,
the reason for it, the date when a response can be expected, and that the applicant has a right
to make a complaint to the Commissioner about the extension.

Model Letter B in Appendix 2 deals with time extensions. This notice is required as soon as it
is apparent that the request cannot be processed within the initial 30-day time period.

When a request for extension is made to the Commissioner, the notice should be sent to the
applicant before the Commissioner’s final decision on the extension has been made.

If an applicant complains to the Commissioner about an extension, the custodian continues to
process the request throughout the review period.

After investigating a complaint about a time limit extension, the Commissioner may either
confirm or reduce the extension of a time limit as provided in section 80(3)(b).

Day of Response
The Alberta Interpretation Act provides that, if the day a response is due falls on a statutory
holiday or a day when the office of the custodian is closed, then the response is due on the
next business day.

The custodian is responsible for determining whether the office that is authorized to respond
is closed. If a small or single custodian’s office is closed for staff vacations, the completion of
the request will be affected and can legitimately be delayed until the first working day after the
office reopens.

Larger custodians will need to establish policies and procedures to specify both the office that
is authorized to receive requests and the hours during which that authorized office is open to
receive requests. For example, although a Health Information Coordinator’s office in a regional
health authority may only be open Monday to Friday until 4:30 or 5:00 p.m, the health records
area (where the records are stored) may be open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 2.4.5

PAYMENT OF FEES

An individual’s right of access (under Part 2 of the Act) to his or her own health information
in a record is subject to the payment of any fee required by the regulations (section 7(3)).
Custodians should collect all outstanding fees before releasing the records to the applicant.

The assessment of fees will also apply to oral requests unless the custodian excuses the
applicant from paying all or part of a fee under section 67(4) if the applicant cannot afford to
pay the fee.

See the discussion on Estimating, Assessing and Excusing Fees under Section 2.5.8 of
this Chapter.

 2.4.6  DEEMED REQUEST UNDER THE FOIP ACT

If a written request for access to a record is made under section 8(1), and the record contains
information that would be subject to the FOIP Act, the part of the request that relates to
that information is deemed to be a request under section 7(1) of the FOIP Act and that Act
applies to that part of the request as if it had been made under section 7(1) of the FOIP Act
(section 16(1)).

This section does not apply if the custodian that receives the request is not a “public body” as
defined in section 1(1)(p) of the FOIP Act. The section would apply, for example, to a regional
health authority. (section 16(3)).

The applicant must be notified regarding the part of the request that will be processed under
the FOIP Act and whether this will affect the timelines for responding. Model Letter A.1 of
Appendix 2 can be used to notify applicants that part (or all) of the request is being deemed
a FOIP Request under the FOIP Act. Since the provisions for processing access requests under
the FOIP Act are very similar to those under Health Information Act, the impact of applying the
FOIP Act to a part of the request should be minimal from the applicant’s perspective.

BEST PRACTICE: If the Health Information Coordinator for a custodian is a different person than
the FOIP Coordinator, it will be important for the coordinators to consult with each other to discuss
any difficult issues. However, the custodian will have to make its decisions regarding the release of
records based upon the application of the act that applies to the relevant portion of the records.

If the FOIP and Health Information Coordinators for the custodian are the same person, a
separate file should be opened and a request number assigned for the part of the request
that will be processed under the FOIP Act so that the steps taken to process the request can
be properly documented. In the event that the applicant complains to the Commissioner or
requests a review of a custodian’s decision, this documentation will be important to support the
procedures followed by the custodian or the decision(s) made in response to the request.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

Section 15.1 of the FOIP Act specifies that if a request for access to a record is made under
section 7 of that Act, and a part of the record contains information to which Health Information
Act applies, the part of the request relating to that information is deemed to be a request under
section 8(1) of the Health Information Act and that Act applies to the processing of that part of
the request.

This section does not apply if the public body that receives the request is not a custodian as
defined in section 1(1)(f) of the Health Information Act.

OIPC Order H2005-004 involved an access request for the complete records of the applicant
from a medical clinic within a hospital. Records were kept in different areas of the hospital,
and the results of a questionnaire were considered “raw data” by the custodian and not
provided in the original access request. In the Order, the Privacy Commissioner noted that it
is the custodian’s duty to provide the requested information, even if it does not fall within the
definition of health information if the information is accessible under the FOIP Act. In this case
the custodian was a public body subject to FOIP, so the questionnaire results should have been
provided and treated as a deemed request under FOIP. Custodians who are public bodies have a
duty to assist applicants with their access requests for non-health information.
(http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

Assessing Fees Where Both Acts May Apply
If a custodian that is also a public body under the FOIP Act (e.g., a regional health authority)
receives a request from an individual to access the individual’s personal information and
the personal information includes health information (e.g., health information contained in
incident reports or employee records), the deeming provisions in section 4.1 of the FOIP Act
will apply. The FOIP Request would become two requests: one under section 7(1) of the FOIP
Act and one under section 8(1) of Health Information Act.

The Fee Schedule in the FOIP Regulation would apply to the personal information requested,
except for the portion of the records containing information to which the Health Information
Act applies. The Fee Schedule under the Health Information Regulation would apply to the
portion of the request related to health information.

BEST PRACTICE: The individual has only made one request to access his or her information.
Although custodians will process different portions of the request under the two Acts, they may wish
to apply the lesser of the two fee schedules, where possible, unless the majority of the information
requested is health information and significant review time will be required.

Under the Health Information Act Fee Schedule, a fee may be charged for the time it takes to review
and determine whether any severing will be required. Under the FOIP Act, a fee cannot be charged
for this review time.

Alternatively, the custodian could consider not assessing fees for a portion of the request.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 2.4.7

RESPONSE TO APPLICANT

Section 12(2) provides that an applicant must be told:

 • whether access to a record or part of it is granted or refused;
 • if access to the record or part of it is granted, where, when and how access will be given,

and

 • if access to the record or part of it is refused:

–  the reasons for the refusal and the provision of the Health Information Act on which the

refusal is based;

–  the name, title, business address and business telephone number of an affiliate who

can answer the applicant’s questions about the refusal; and

–  that the applicant may ask for a review of the decision by the Commissioner under

section 73(1).

BEST PRACTICE: When providing an applicant with access to his or her own personal information,
a custodian must be satisfied that the individual receiving the information is, indeed, the individual
the information is about or a duly appointed representative of that individual. For information on
the exercise of rights by other persons, see Chapter 2.3.3 of this Publication.

Identification can usually be confirmed from the context of the request process, but where there
is doubt, or the record contains diagnostic, treatment or care information, the custodian should
request normal identification (e.g., photo identification such as a driver’s licence) before providing
the information. The identification only needs to be examined, not recorded (collected).

 2.4.8  MODEL RESPONSES

Model Letters E, F and G in Appendix 2 of this Publication provide guidance and options for
drafting the various types of final responses to the Health Information Act requests.

In all cases when access is denied, the response letter must state that, if the applicant requests
a review of the decision by the Commissioner he or she should provide the Commissioner with:

 • the request number assigned by the custodian;
 • a copy of the decision letter; and
 • a copy of the original request.

Generally, the response letter should address the outcomes of the search and review of records
in response to a request.

Access is Provided
There is a determination that access will be provided because the information falls within the
scope of the Act, and the information does not qualify for any exception under section 11.
If it qualifies for a discretionary exception, the custodian has used its discretion in favour of
releasing the information.

47

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

Some requests will involve records that take little time to review or are easily releasable. In
these instances, the custodian should release available records as soon as possible rather than
waiting until all records are ready for disclosure. This can occur when part of the request
is deemed to be a request under the FOIP Act (section 16(1)) or when the records contain
information that requires further consultation. This situation could occur when some of the
requested records were created by another custodian.

The applicant will have indicated, in accordance with section 8(3), whether he or she wishes
to have a copy of the record or to examine the record. If the request is for a copy and it can be
reasonably reproduced, the copy should be included in the response package. This will be done
only if the fees have been paid.

If it is not possible to include the records, the applicant should be given the reason for the
delay and told where, when and how the copy will be provided.

In some instances, the applicant may have asked to examine a record but the record cannot
be reasonably severed for examination, or the record is in a format that does not readily lend
itself to examination (e.g., a microfilm with much information on it that may be subject to
exceptions under the Act). In these instances, the custodian may choose to provide a copy of
the record to the applicant.

Access is Denied
Access is denied to all or part of a record if the information falls within a mandatory exception;
the information falls within a discretionary exception and the decision is to deny access; or the
information lies outside the scope of the Act. In these instances, the response provides:

 • the reasons for refusal and the sections (specific subsections and paragraphs, where

possible) on which the refusal is based;

 • the name, title, business address and business telephone number of the custodian or

affiliate, e.g., Health Information Coordinator, who will answer any questions the applicant
may have about the response; and

 • a statement that the applicant has the right to request a review of the decision under
section 73(1) and that this request must be made within 60 days after the person
asking for the review is notified of the decision, or any longer period allowed by the
Commissioner (section 74(2)).

 2.4.9  DEALING WITH REPETITIOUS OR SYSTEMATIC REQUESTS

Under section 87, at the request of a custodian, the Commissioner may authorize the custodian
to disregard one or more requests for access to or correction of the individual’s own health
information (under section 8(1) or 13(1)). The custodian must present facts in support of
its request.

Health and Wellness

48

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

A custodian may be allowed to disregard a request or requests if:

 • because of their repetitious or systematic nature, the requests would unreasonably interfere

with the operation of the custodian or amount to an abuse of the right to make those
requests, or

 • one or more of the requests are frivolous or vexatious.

A request is “repetitious” if it is one in a series of requests by an applicant for substantially the
same information or records.

Requests might be viewed as repetitious in cases where the applicant:

 • continues to apply repeatedly for the same or similar information even though the
original request has been disposed of and there is nothing new or different in the
responsive records;

 • continues to ask for corrections of particular opinions about him or herself when a decision

has been made and the record has been annotated;

 • makes the same request to a custodian before the previous request has been completed or

any review or investigation procedure carried out.

A request is “systematic” in nature if it is part of an extensive pattern of related requests by an
applicant or a group of applicants.

Requests might be considered systematic in nature when a single applicant (or a group of
applicants) make(s) a large number of the same or similar requests; or regularly makes a
request and then, after receiving a fee estimate, splits up the request into several separate
requests to avoid fees.

A custodian may only request authorization to disregard repetitious or systematic requests if
processing the request would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the custodian or
amount to abuse of the right of access.

“Unreasonably interfere with operations” might be demonstrated by showing the impact that
particular repetitious or systematic requests are having on the resources needed to respond
within a custodian and the actual costs of providing a response.

“Abuse of the Right of Access” arises when the action of an applicant is demonstrably a misuse
of the Health Information Act. It may be obvious that requests are not being made to obtain
information or achieve a legitimate correction of information, but rather to tie up the resources
of the custodian or frustrate the administration of a particular program or activity.

A request may be “frivolous or vexatious” if it has no sound basis in fact or is malicious. The
applicant may not necessarily be making repeat requests or abusing his or her right of access
under the Act, although that may be the case.

A custodian might support an argument that a request is frivolous or vexatious with reference
to a past pattern of conduct that indicates an abuse of the process for access or with evidence
that shows that the request is made in bad faith or for a purpose other than to obtain access
to information.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

Examples of requests that might be considered frivolous or vexatious include:

 • continual requests for records that a custodian has already established it does not have;
 • requests involving fees made by an applicant who has demonstrated a pattern of

abandoning a request whenever a fee waiver is not granted or the Commissioner upholds a
fee; or

 • requests that show an intention to harass a public body, to “break” the system, or to

engage in “information warfare”.

When requesting the Commissioner’s decision in such a case, the custodian might provide
evidence of the considerable costs and time involved in dealing with a particular applicant or
group of applicants.

No single factor will determine whether a request is frivolous or vexatious. Custodians need
to present a case based on the history of requests by an applicant and the context of those
requests, when asking for authority to disregard a request.

Asking for authorization to disregard requests should be rare. Custodians should ensure that
they have fully discharged their duty to assist applicants in a full and forthright manner and
have a strong case before seeking such authorization.

 2.4.10  DEADLINES WHEN REQUESTING AUTHORIZATION TO DISREGARD

FRIVOLOUS OR VEXATIOUS REQUESTS

If a custodian requests authorization to disregard an access request, or a request for correction
or amendment, the processing of the request ceases until the Commissioner makes a decision,
which, in effect, “stops the clock”. If the Commissioner does not authorize disregarding the
request, processing of the access request or the request for a correction or amendment should
resume, and the countdown of days remaining in the deadline continues, starting on the
day the Privacy Commissioner informs the custodian of the decision. If the Commissioner
does authorize the custodian to disregard the request then processing does not resume.
(section 87(2))

 2.5

ADMINISTERING THE REQUEST PROCESS

Custodians should develop procedures to govern the processing of requests and to ensure that
processing occurs within established time limits and in accordance with the requirements of
the Health Information Act.

 2.5.1

RECEIVING AND LOGGING THE REQUEST

Once a request is received by a custodian (this could be in the office of the Health Information
Coordinator of a large or decentralized custodian or in the office of a single custodian), it
should be registered and logged. This could be done electronically if an automated tracking
system is in use.

Health and Wellness

50

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

It should then be placed in a request file and details of the request forwarded to any other
office or program area of a custodian that has custody or control of the requested health
record(s). In a regional health authority, for example, a request for all of a former patient’s
health information may have to be sent to several hospitals, contracted laboratory service
providers, etc. The office of the affiliate that has been designated as responsible for processing
access requests under the Health Information Act (section 62(1)) can record the assignment of
responsibility on the request tracking system.

Custodians may want to use an Access Request Review Form (see Appendix 1 of this
Publication) to record all activities and the time involved in processing the request, in order to
document the activities and assess the appropriate fees.

The identity of the applicant will be needed to locate and retrieve records containing the
applicant’s health information but should be disclosed only:

 • to those officials and employees of the custodian who have a need to know it in order to

carry out their job duties; and

 • to the extent necessary to carry out the custodian’s function in processing the

applicant’s request.

 2.5.2

CLARIFYING THE REQUEST

A request may be overly general or vague because the applicant lacks knowledge of the
custodian’s operations or programs and the type of health records that may be available.

If a request does not sufficiently describe the records sought, a public body should advise the
applicant and offer to help clarify or narrow the request. Model Letter A in Appendix 2 can be
used in this situation.

If it appears from the health record that another custodian may have some or all of the records
requested by the applicant, the applicant should be notified of this and advised that he or she
may make a separate request for that health information to the other custodian.

There are several things to keep in mind when trying to define or clarify a request.

Release of Information Outside the Health Information Act
If the information can be released through a more routine process, it should be released to the
applicant without delay. However, any routine process for release must still comply with the
rules in the Act. The applicant should be advised that such information is available without a
request under the Act and that similar information can be obtained outside the Act in future. If
only part of the information can be released in this routine manner, the rest of the request can
be processed under the Act.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

Narrowing a Request
If an applicant has requested a large amount of information that could result in significant fees
being assessed, the Health Information Coordinator should try to narrow the request while
still meeting the applicant’s information needs. This could result in a reduction in fees and
provision of better service, in terms of both time and results.

For example, narrowing the period of time over which the health information of an individual
is sought, and specifying the health facilities within a regional health authority where the
individual was a patient could reduce the search time and the amount of fees assessed.

If the scope of a request has been changed, the custodian should document the change and
send a notice to the applicant (see Model Letter A in Appendix 2). In cases where an applicant
makes additional requests, or expands the scope of the access request significantly, or the
complexity of the request has increased, the custodian may need to re-evaluate the timeline
for responding to the request. If responding to the request within the original deadline is not
feasible, the custodian could grant itself a 30 day extension if it has not already done so. If
it has already implemented the 30 day deadline, the custodian could appeal to the Privacy
Commissioner for a further extension. If the nature of the request has changed significantly,
the custodian could treat it as a second access request with a new deadline while continuing
to process the original request with the original deadline. Another alternative is to treat both
requests as a new access request with a new timeline. Whenever the deadline is extended, or
the custodian uses one of these options for dealing with multiple requests, the applicant must
be kept well informed. There is always the option of appealing to the Privacy Commissioner if
the applicant is not happy with the reinterpretation of an access request, or the handling of a
timeline. See OIPC Order H2005-004 for further discussion.

 2.5.3  ACKNOWLEDGING THE REQUEST

The custodian should acknowledge receipt of a request. This acknowledgment may say that
the request:

 • has been received and processing will commence;
 • is incomplete because the initial fee has not been paid and is required before processing

can commence;

 • is not clear or precise enough and more information is needed to clarify it before

processing can commence; or

 • if part of the request is deemed to be a request under the FOIP Act, how that part will be

dealt with.

If processing cannot start immediately, an effort should be made to contact the applicant by
telephone to resolve any problems quickly. A written follow-up to this call is good practice. It
will provide a definite reference point as to when processing commenced.

Model Letter A in Appendix 2 sets out the options for acknowledging receipt of a request.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 2.5.4

LOCATING AND RETRIEVING RECORDS

Under section 10, a custodian must make every reasonable effort to respond to an applicant
openly, accurately and completely. Normally, the area responsible for the custody or control of
records relevant to a request would be asked to locate and retrieve the records.

This responsibility may be delegated to the medical records technician or medical records unit
of a health facility or clinic or it may rest with a staff member of a physician’s or pharmacist’s
office. The retrieval of records would include any records that may reside in individual
employee’s offices, vehicles or homes, including electronic records, or in filing systems in
storage areas. When applicable, records in the possession of contracted agencies may have to
be located.

The support of records or information management staff may be needed to provide the indices
and guides to appropriate records, where these are available, and to locate records.

Speed and accuracy are essential in identifying, locating, retrieving and, where appropriate,
copying records relevant to a request. Where a request is for a large number of records, it may
be appropriate that copies are not made immediately.

For a larger, decentralized custodian, a rule of thumb for a basic, uncomplicated request
involving the coordination of staff in different areas is that four working days are needed to
retrieve pertinent records that need to be reviewed.

Scope of Search
The Act applies to all health information, as defined in the legislation, including health
information in electronic records, in the custody or under the control of the custodian. All
records, in any form, that are responsive to the request, must be located and retrieved.

All areas where records are held – central active files, working files in individual offices,
electronic repositories and off-site storage areas – must be searched and staff requested to
produce relevant records, in accordance with the nature of the request. Any relevant records
in the possession of contracted agencies and under the control of the custodian will have to
be located, copied, if appropriate, and transferred to the Health Information Coordinator or
individual processing the request.

An applicant can ask the Information and Privacy Commissioner to review the adequacy
of a search to locate records (section 85(a)). When this happens, the custodian will have
to demonstrate that it made a reasonable search of all areas and repositories where records
relevant to the request might be located. See OIPC Orders 96-022, H2006-003, H2005-004,
and H2005-003 for the criteria the Commissioner uses in judging the adequacy of a search
for records.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

For example, in Order H2006-003 the Privacy Commissioner states that speculation that further
information might exist is not sufficient reason to find that a custodian has failed to conduct
an adequate search for responsive records. Furthermore, locating different records in different
searches does not necessarily mean that a custodian has failed to conduct an adequate search
(Orders H2005-003, F2003-001). Previous orders say that what must be considered when
determining the adequacy of a search is the effort made by the custodian in the circumstances
of the case, including the thoroughness of the search.

The HIA does not specify who has the burden of proof to determine if the custodian made every
reasonable effort to assist the Applicant and to respond to the applicant openly, accurately and
completely. When the Act does not indicate which party has the burden of proof, the OIPC has
determined in previous orders that the party best able to demonstrate whether the duties have
been met or not has the burden of proof. (See OIPC Order H2006-003 The approach taken in
previous orders (H2005-007, H2005-006, F2004-005 and H2004-001) established that other
duties in HIA are not linked to the duty to assist unless those duties are expressly linked by the
legislation. (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

Custodians need to be aware that if the applicant is known to already be in possession of a
document, this does not negate the need to provide it in response to an access request. This
includes documents that the applicant has created, such as previous letters requesting access
to their information. The custodian needs to confirm with the applicant as to whether or not
copies of such documents are required by the applicant.

In Order H2005-004 the applicant made a series of requests for all documents in his file.
Previous requests for access to his records were not included with the records provided. As well,
a consent to disclosure of health information for research purposes, with comments indicating
that the applicant was revoking the consent, was also omitted from the access request, and was
only provided when subsequently it was specifically requested by the applicant. This led the
applicant to believe that the custodian was withholding information.

Custodians must not dispose of any records relating to a request after it is received, even
if the records are scheduled for destruction under an approved records retention and
disposition schedule.

This includes any e-mail and transitory records relevant to the request that may exist at the
time the request is received. The receipt of a request under section 7(1) freezes all disposition
action relating to the records covered by the request until the request has been completed and
any appeal to the Commissioner decided.

When a request is transmitted to the area or individual responsible for the records, the area or
individual should be reminded that it is an offence to knowingly destroy any record (section
107(1)(b)) or to alter, falsify or conceal any record, or to direct another person to do so
(section 107(1)(b)), in order to evade a request for access to the record. These offences are
punishable by a fine for an individual up to $10,000 and for any other person up to $50,000.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

Where records have been destroyed prior to the receipt of a request, in accordance with an
approved records retention and disposition schedule, the custodian’s response to the applicant
should indicate that the records have been destroyed, quoting the authority for, and date
of destruction.

When records have been transferred to the Provincial Archives of Alberta (e.g., in the case of
Alberta Health and Wellness) or the archives of a custodian, the applicant should be advised
that a request for the records should be made to the appropriate archives.

 2.5.5

COPYING RETRIEVED RECORDS

Once the records have been located, either the program area in a larger custodian or the office
of the Health Information Coordinator, as appropriate, prepares them for review and completes
the request documentation.

This may involve copying and numbering all records pertinent to the request and preparing:

 • a list of all records areas searched;
 • a list of the records located in each records area, along with identifying data and parts of

file lists, data dictionaries or other finding aids used in locating the records; and

 • a log of staff time spent searching for and retrieving the records.

When there are a large number of records involved, lists of the records rather than copies of
them may be more appropriate.

 2.5.6

PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT

Questions that the Health Information Coordinator should ask at this stage are:
 • Have all relevant records been located and do they satisfy the request?
 • Are there any records referenced in the request or in the located records that have not yet

been located?

 • Are any of the records subject to other legislation that prevails over the Health

Information Act?

 • Can the records, in whole or in part, be released immediately without line by line review?
 • Where all or a portion of the request concerns records that were created by or are under
the control of another custodian, should the applicant be advised of his or her right to
make a separate request to that custodian?
 • Should the search for records be widened?
 • What is the extent and nature of consultation required with other program areas within
the custodian? Responsibility for ensuring that these consultations occur should be
clearly assigned.

 • What is the extent and nature of external consultation required with other custodians

or non-custodians? Responsibility for conducting these consultations should be
clearly assigned.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 • Will the time required to respond to the request likely exceed the 30-day time limit? Are

there grounds for an extension of the time limit?
 • Will fees be assessed for processing of the request?

Based upon this preliminary review, the Health Information Coordinator may, depending upon
his or her level of responsibility, either recommend or undertake actions related to:

 • the immediate release of all or some of the records;
 • the extension of time limits; or
 • the assessment of fees.

 2.5.7  NOTICES

Various notices are required under the Act. Of particular importance are those provided:

 • to inform an applicant of a fee estimate;
 • to report to an applicant about the progress of a request (e.g., time limit extension); and
 • to advise the applicant of the decision on the disclosure and provide information about

access to the records if access is granted.

Section 103 provides that a notice or other document that is required by the Act to be given to
a person be provided:

 • by sending it by prepaid mail to the last known address of the person;
 • by handing it to the individual personally (i.e., personal service);
 • by substitutional service, if that is authorized by the Commissioner; or
 • by means of a machine or device that electronically transmits a copy of a document,

picture or other printed materials by means of a telecommunications system.

The choice of how to give notice or send a document depends on the circumstances. Normal
methods will be by mail and fax, since these are common, effective ways of communicating.
There will be circumstances when other methods may have to be used. This may be the case
when addresses are uncertain, or when there is a need to assure delivery to a specific person.

“Personal service” means a method of delivery where it can be shown that the person to be
served actually received the document (e.g., using a process server).

“Substitutional service” usually takes the form of a notice presented in the media. This may
be a general notice (appearing in newspapers and weekly journals) or a more specific notice
published in certain trade magazines for a particular sector.

Custodians should assess the circumstances requiring the notice and choose the most
economical and effective approach.

The Model Letters B and C in Appendix 2 provide examples and options for the notices
required under the legislation.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 2.5.8

ESTIMATING, ASSESSING AND EXCUSING FEES

Section 7(3) states that the right of access to a record is subject to the payment of any fee
required by the regulations. Section 67(1) gives custodians the power to charge the fees
provided for in the regulations for services provided under Part 2 of the Act (Individual’s Right
to Access Individual’s Health Information).

The fees that may be charged relate to the steps that a custodian takes to produce a copy of the
individual’s own health information.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is not charged on fees for processing Health Information
Act requests for the Department, a regional health authority, hospitals, nursing homes and
provincial health boards. However, physicians and other small custodians will be required to
charge GST on fees.

Under section 10(1) of the Health Information Regulation, a custodian may require an
applicant who makes a request for access to a record containing health information to pay
a basic fee of $25.00 for performing one or more of the following steps to produce a copy of
the information:

 • receiving and clarifying the request;
 • obtaining consent if necessary;
 • locating and retrieving the records;
 • preparing the record for copying, including removing staples and paper clips;
 • preparing a response letter;
 • packaging copies for shipping or faxing, or both; postage and faxing costs; and
 • photocopying a record

Under the FOIP Act, the basic fee is called an initial fee but may only be charged for requests
for general records, not personal information, under that Act. If the basic fee applies, a
custodian will not start processing a request until the basic fee has been paid (section 10(2)) of
the Health Information Regulation).

In addition to the basic fee, a custodian may charge additional fees for producing a copy of a
record, in accordance with the Fee Schedule. The fees set out in the Schedule are the maximum
fees that can be charged to applicants (section 1 of the Fee Schedule) and can be waived or
reduced if they would be a financial hardship for the applicant.

If the cost of photocopying a record, calculated at $0.25 per page, exceeds $5.00, the fees in the
Schedule may be charged but only the amount that exceeds $5.00 may be charged (section 2 of
the Schedule).

The fees in the Schedule cover the costs of:

 • copying records created in various media or formats;
 • supervising an applicant’s examination of original records;
 • determining whether a record requires severing;
 • reviewing and identifying the parts of the record to be severed;

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 • producing a record from an electronic record; and
 • other direct costs such as charges to retrieve records or return records, or both, from
another location, and courier charges, delivery charges, or both, to send copies to an
applicant other than by mail or fax.

For example, in OIPC Order H2005-002 the Applicant complained that a pharmacy (the
Custodian) had improperly estimated the fee for services under section 67(3) of the HIA. The
Commissioner found that the Custodian could not charge the “professional fee” portion of
the fee estimate. The Commissioner ordered the Custodian to provide a fee estimate to the
Applicant that was in accordance with the Act.

The Applicant was authorized by a Power of Attorney to make an access request on behalf of his
father for prescription records for the previous three years.

The Custodian’s fee estimate was as follows;

Initiate and Review Request

Professional Fee @ $40.00/hr.

$25.00

$40.00

(i.e., Professional fee to include time, photocopies and advice to [name of Portfolio Officer]).

When the Applicant complained the Custodian refused to modify the fee estimate. The
Applicant requested a review of the decision by the OIPC.

The Custodian stated that providing the records would involve a great deal of time and
expense. It also stated the “professional fee” included compensation for the time it would take
to respond to the request for access and to photocopy the record. However, these general items
are already included in the $25.00 “basic fee”. Unless these items fall within the ‘additional fees’
that are allowed under section 10(3) of the Regulation, as outlined in section 2 of the Schedule
in the Regulation, they are not authorized under HIA. For example, if photocopying costs
exceed $5.00, the Custodian is entitled to charge the ‘additional fees’ prescribed.

In OIPC Order H2005-002 the Commissioner ordered the Custodian to properly estimate the
fee for services in accordance with the Act. (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

Fee Estimates
Section 67(3) says that a custodian must give an applicant an estimate of the total fee for its
services before providing the services.

When a custodian decides to charge additional fees for processing an access request, the
custodian must calculate the fee strictly in accordance with section 67(3) of the Act and as
described in sections 10 and 11 of the Regulation and in the Schedule to the Regulation.

Under section 11(1) of the Health Information Regulation, an estimate provided to an applicant
must set out:

 • the time and cost required to prepare the record for disclosure, including severing time and

to retrieve records from another location;

 • the cost of copying the record;

Health and Wellness

58

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 • the cost of computer time involved in locating and copying a record, or, if necessary, re-

programming to create a new record;

 • the cost of supervising an applicant who wishes to examine the original record, when

applicable; and

 • the cost of shipping the record or a copy of the record, other than by mail or fax.

The fee estimate is provided to the applicant as part of a notice that includes:

 • a request that at least 50 per cent of the estimate be paid in advance of the request

being processed;

 • a statement that the applicant has 20 days to inform the custodian that the estimate is

accepted and to pay the deposit; and

 • a statement that the applicant has the right to ask the custodian to excuse all or part of

the fee and may request a review by the Commissioner if a request for fee waiver has not
been granted.

Model Letter C in Appendix 2 may be used to provide this notice. The information in the
notice gives the applicant the basis on which to accept the charges or take other action.

An applicant has up to 20 days to indicate if the fee estimate is accepted or to modify the
request to change the amount of fees assessed (section 11(2) of the Health Information
Regulation). The applicant may choose to modify the request so as to change the amount of
fees assessed. In that case, a notice of a new fee estimate may need to be sent. If no response
has been received after 30 days, the custodian may declare the request to be abandoned
(section 9). (See section 2.6 later in this Chapter).

Fee estimates are not binding. However, a custodian should do its best to estimate what the
fees will be. The custodian can revise its estimate in the course of processing the request, and
may do so in cases where, for example, records are poorly organized. If the estimate is too
high, a refund should be made to the applicant. If a fee estimate is too low, the custodian has
the discretion to request additional fees from an applicant.

If the fees will be higher, this must be addressed with the applicant as soon as it becomes
apparent and not be left to the end of the processing period.

Deposit and Payment of Fees
Section 12(1) of the Health Information Regulation says that processing of a request stops once
a notice of estimate has been forwarded to an applicant and starts again immediately when
the custodian receives an agreement to pay the fee and receives at least 50 per cent of any
estimated fee.

The custodian should wait until:

 • a letter from the applicant agreeing to the charges and attaching payment of the deposit is

received in the authorized office of the custodian;

 • written notification from the applicant modifying the request, and establishing a new basis

for assessment of fees, is received in the authorized office of the custodian;

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 • the custodian agrees to a request for a fee waiver; or
 • the Commissioner carries out a review and decides whether the fees are appropriate, or

whether the custodian has appropriately exercised discretion regarding a request for excuse
of payment of fees, as applicable.

The balance of any fee owing is payable at the time the information is delivered to the
applicant (section 12(2) of the Health Information Regulation).

If the amount paid is higher than the actual fees required to be paid, the balance paid will
be refunded.

The applicant should not be provided with access to a record until all fees owing for the
processing of the request have been paid (section 7(3) of the Act).

Custodians, other than the department, should arrange for fees paid to be handled in the same
way as other revenue. The department must process fees in accordance with directions from
Alberta Treasury.

Excusing the Payment of Fees
Section 67(4) allows a custodian to excuse an applicant from paying all or part of a fee if, in
the opinion of the custodian, the applicant cannot afford the fee or in any other circumstances
provided for in the regulations.

Section 13 of the Health Information Regulation says that the “other circumstances” would
depend upon the opinion of the custodian as to whether it would be fair to excuse payment of
all or a part of a fee.

If the custodian refuses an applicant’s request to excuse the payment of all or part of a
fee, the custodian must notify the applicant that the applicant may ask for a review by the
Commissioner (section 67(5)).

Normally, an applicant will take the initiative in requesting that fees be excused, usually at
the time of submitting the request. A custodian must consider the request for such an excuse
from an applicant at the time it is made. If a request for excusing the payment of fees is part of
the Health Information Act request, the custodian will consider this when it is preparing a fee
estimate and decide whether an excuse of payment is merited.

The custodian does not need to excuse the payment of all fees if it decides to grant
such a request. It can consider reducing the fee by a part of its total or not charging for
certain services.

Reasons for Excusing the Payment of Fees
1.  Applicant Cannot Afford to Pay
Applicants who are indigent or living on social benefits may require access to their health
information. Normally, applicants will state in a request why they are seeking to excuse the
payment of fees. If they do not or if more information is required, the Health Information
Coordinator or whomever is dealing with the applicant should phone the applicant and seek
the information needed to make a decision.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

Applicants should not have to undergo a wealth or means test to qualify for this type of
payment excuse but basic information on income and situation should be sought to satisfy the
custodian that an applicant may fall into this category. For instance, applicants may be asked
to show evidence that they would suffer hardship if they were obliged to pay the required fee,
including general information about their sources of income.

2.  It is Fair to Excuse Payment
This provision covers situations where a custodian is of the view that reducing or excusing
fees would be fair or appropriate under the circumstances of that particular applicant and that
particular request.

An example of this might be where an individual can show that access to his or her own health
information is vital to the exercise of his or her rights. In OIPC Order F2006-001, an applicant
had applied to have the basic $25 access fee for a FOIP request waived. The Public Body had
refused, citing the fact that they had never granted a fee waiver in the past, and were not
prepared to do so in this case. Granting a fee waiver is a discretionary decision, and in this case
the OIPC ruled that the Public Body did not properly exercise discretion in making its decision.
A Public Body, or a custodian under HIA, must consider the individual’s circumstances to
meet its legal obligation. In this case the applicant was an inmate in a provincial correctional
facility and had little or no money due to his incarceration. He could not earn money due
to his incarceration, and was required to cover expenses for basic personal care, food and
communications. The applicant did provide some evidence that he received little money. The
$25 access fee was a real barrier to him accessing the information. The Public Body asserted that
the information he requested was available for free elsewhere. The applicant, however, provided
documentation that he had previously attempted to obtain the information elsewhere through
other channels and was unable to obtain the information, despite being told he going through
the proper channels.

Due to his limited financial resources in combination with the unfair treatment he received from
the Public Body, the OIPC ordered the Public Body to reduce the fee to zero.

 2.5.9

CONSULTING WITH OTHERS

In some cases, the records requested may include information that could be subject to a
discretionary exception under section 11(1) and another custodian may need to be consulted
to determine whether portions of the record(s) should be severed under an exception. For
example, a hospital may need to consult with an individual’s private physician to determine
if disclosure of the records could reasonably be expected to result in harm to the applicant, to
threaten the health or safety of another individual or to pose a threat to public safety (section
11(1)(a)). See section 3.1.2. of this publication for discussion on the criteria for probable harm.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

In Order F2004-005 and H2004-001 the applicant requested his mental health records
from three hospitals in the health region. The region provided every page from the record,
but severed the names, initials and other identifiers of individuals in the health, justice, law
enforcement, corrections, and legal systems. The reason provided was that the disclosure could
reasonably be expected to threaten the mental or physical health or safety of other individuals
and to pose a threat to public safety. The health region withheld the information based on
the medical opinion of a psychiatrist who stated that the names of persons other than the
individual should be severed. The applicant appealed the decision to the OIPC. The Privacy
Commissioner did not attach much weight to the sworn affidavit from the psychiatrist stating
that the three criteria for harm were met since it merely stated that the three criteria were met.
There were no facts, examples or illustrations to demonstrate that the criteria were met. In this
case, the Privacy Commissioner consulted the health records. A custodian can meet the burden
of proof by providing records as evidence. The records revealed a pattern of behaviour that did
indicate that disclosing the identifiers could reasonably be expected to threaten the health or
safety of other individuals.

In OIPC Order F2005-017 and H2005-001, the applicant wanted access to her teenage
daughter’s psychological questionnaire results. It was a psychologist with the health region
who wrote a letter to the mother stating that the daughter was a “mature minor” and would
therefore need to be involved in any decisions about her hospital records.

On the other hand, if a health record includes referral letters containing health information
from other custodians or health information provided by another physician acting in a
consultant capacity, consultation with the other physician before disclosing the records, subject
to any applicable exceptions, would not normally be required. The existence of those records
on the applicant’s file may lead the applicant to make a request for access to their own health
information that may be in the custody of that other custodian.

 2.5.10  REVIEWING RECORDS

Once the preliminary assessment has been completed, the various administrative matters
have been sorted out and any necessary consultations are under way, someone will need to
review the record(s) line by line. This could be done by a knowledgeable officer from the
area responsible for the requested records; someone in the office of the Health Information
Coordinator; or in smaller offices or the office of a single custodian, a person knowledgeable
about the records and knowledgeable about the exceptions under the Act.

A line by line review is essential to comply with the principle of severability set out in
section 7(2). This provision grants an applicant a right of access to any record containing their
own health information from which excepted information can be reasonably severed.

Health and Wellness

62

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

Chapter 3 of this Publication deals with the guidelines for the application of the exceptions
to the right of access. A person knowledgeable about the records can offer their perspective
on any harm that may result from release of particular information and can identify factors
to be taken into consideration when exercising discretion to release or refuse access to the
information. During the line by line review, the office of the Health Information Coordinator
(for larger custodians) may identify additional requirements with respect to consultations.

Documentation
During the line by line review, the reviewer should document exceptions to be invoked (based
upon section 11), actions to be taken, reasons for each decision, and recommendations for
responding to the request.

An Access Request Review Form is provided in Appendix 1 of this Publication and may be
adapted for internal use. This form provides a detailed record of the results of the review and
recommendations on the application of exceptions.

Thorough documentation at this stage ensures that the custodian has the information required
to assess recommendations and to make final decisions relatively quickly. It minimizes
duplication of effort and ensures that the custodian is in a position to explain decisions both
to the applicant and to the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner, if there is a
request for a review.

Reviewer’s Recommendations
The reviewer should prepare a summary of recommendations that identifies:

 • information recommended for release;
 • specific records or parts of records excluded from the scope of the Act or which may be

deemed to be included in a request for access to information under the FOIP Act;

 • specific records or parts of records to which mandatory or discretionary exceptions to

disclosure apply, with the reviewer’s recommendations and reasons with respect to the
discretionary exceptions (see Chapter 3 of this Publication for guidance on the exercise of
discretion); and

 • other general factors that may be pertinent in reaching a decision on a response to

the request.

For larger custodians, these recommendations can form the basis for a discussion on the
contents of a response between the office of the Health Information Coordinator and the area
responsible for the records, or between the Coordinator and the official who makes release or
refusal decisions.

For smaller custodians, the discussion might occur between a physician or pharmacist and the
staff member who reviewed the records. For single custodians, the above recommendations
could act as a checklist for decision-making.

At this stage, any legal advice needed to resolve issues arising from the request should be
sought. Any interpretive or policy issues which need to be raised should be identified and
consultation undertaken.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

For larger custodians, a designated Health Information Coordinator or other official designated
to make decisions regarding access requests should prepare a final report containing:
 • a log of staff time spent copying the records and for locating, retrieving and

reviewing records;

 • a summary of file systems, offices and records storage facilities searched;
 • copies of records relevant to the request (where this is possible and appropriate given the

volume of records or the fact that the applicant wishes to view the original records);
 • documentation of the line by line review, identifying the specific information that is

proposed to be excepted from access;

 • a summary of results of consultations with other custodians (where that has occurred);

and

 • a written summary of recommendations for release or refusal, including any background

information to explain decisions.

The Access Request Recommendation Form in Appendix 1 of this Publication can serve as the
authority to produce the response to the applicant and should be signed by the official who has
been designated as responsible for making decisions about access on behalf of the custodian.
For smaller, simpler requests, or where a request is made to a single custodian, a written
memo documenting the information above for the final report, approved by the individual
designated as the responsible person to approve responses to applicants, would be sufficient for
this purpose.

Responsive Information
Records that have been retrieved in an initial search may include information that is not
responsive to the request. Careful examination of the request is required to ensure that the
reply is complete but also that information that does not respond to the request is removed.

The fact that an applicant already has or knows the substance of the information or has
knowledge of the contents of the records, does not mean that the record can be considered
non-responsive. The obligation of the custodian is to address the applicant’s entire request (see
OIPC Order H2005-004). However, a custodian and an applicant may agree not to make copies
of certain records (that an applicant may already have) in order to save costs.

Removal of non-responsive information must occur before severing takes place in accordance
with the exceptions in the Act. A custodian may treat portions of a record as non-responsive
if they are clearly separate and distinct and entirely unrelated to the access request
(see OIPC Order 97-020).  http://www.oipc.ab.ca

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 2.5.11  SEVERING INFORMATION

Records may contain both information that can be released and other information that should
be excepted from disclosure. When information that falls within an exception can reasonably
be severed from a record, an applicant has a right of access to the remainder of the record
(section 7(2)).

When a discretionary exception applies, a custodian must use discretion not only in applying
the exception, but also in determining how much of the information is severed. This is the
reason for doing a line by line review of a record. The object of severing is the use of discretion
to release as much information as possible, without causing the harm contemplated by
the exception.

Scope
Severing applies to all records regardless of format or previous actions taken. The fact that
an applicant may have already obtained copies of some of the records in other ways does not
preclude severing to respond to a request (see OIPC Order 98-016  http://www.oipc.ab.ca).

When severing is required for information stored on specialized media, technical expertise
should be sought as to the best way to excise information while recording that severing has
been done and for what reason.

In some cases, a record cannot be severed. The custodian must then refuse access to the whole
record and must be prepared to demonstrate to the Information and Privacy Commissioner the
technical reasons underlying the inability to sever. Examples include the health information of
two or more individuals so intertwined in a record that severing would be extremely difficult
and time-consuming, or when, after severing, the severed record would make no sense
(see OIPC Order 96-019  http://www.oipc.ab.ca).

Procedures
During the line by line review of records pertinent to a request, the reviewer should mark
up copies of paper-based records and keep notes about information in other media that may
qualify for an exception. The review and severing of records may require a significant amount
of time. The procedure should ensure that all records responsive to the request are reviewed.

The objective in severing is to remove only the information that falls within an exception. The
Act requires that all health information contained in a record that is responsive to the request
and that will be intelligible to the applicant after severing, be disclosed.

The severing process is governed by reasonableness, and the custodian exercises discretion in
determining whether discrete portions of information contribute to the overall understanding of
the subject matter at issue.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

BEST PRACTICE: Where affiliates are drafting health records that contain information that could
be subject to an exception (e.g., recommendations for advice, or another individual’s health
information), they should be encouraged to draft the record so that such information is put in a
separate section of the record. This will make the severing process more efficient.

Part of the final decision as to what information will be released and what information will be
refused is also a decision on the extent to which the severing process will be applied. Once that
decision is made, the Health Information Coordinator, or other individual authorized to do the
severing, can use several methods of severing:

 • use of non-permanent white tape over the excepted portion of a copy of the record and

recopying to obtain the record to be released;

 • use of liquid eraser over the excepted portion of a copy of the record and recopying to

obtain the record to be released; or

 • use of a photocopying machine with editing features suitable for severing.

Whatever method of severing is selected, the Coordinator or person with this designated
responsibility must ensure that none of the excepted information remains visible. For this
reason, the use of markers is not recommended.

Indication of Severing
A custodian must indicate the section number (and subsection, where applicable) of any
exception used to sever information, either in the space left after the severing or in the
margin closest to the severed information. If an entire page is removed, the number of pages
severed must be indicated, along with a reference to the applicable exception(s) used to sever
the information.

In cases where a single page or a continuous sequence of pages has been totally severed, the
exception(s) applied and the pages to which they applied should be listed in the response letter
or collated on a single page. It is not necessary or helpful to provide applicants with multiple
blank pages.

In some cases, especially with mandatory exceptions, placing the relevant section in the space
of the severed information may itself reveal or imply information that could cause harm. In
these circumstances, it is permissible for the public body to omit section numbers on the
severed pages and list the relevant sections supporting severance in the letter of notification.

Indicating the section numbers used to sever information from records helps an applicant
understand why part of the information requested has been refused and permits an
independent review of the decisions made by the custodian. The applicable sections of the Act
could be included in the response to the applicant for greater clarity.

See OIPC Practice Note No. 2, Informing the Applicant of Grounds for Refusal.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 2.5.12  DOCUMENTING AND TRACKING REQUESTS

Custodians should maintain documentation systems to record all deliberations and decisions
regarding the processing of requests and to help ensure that the request process meets the
requirements set out in the Act.

The documentation may become a critical part of the evidence required during a review by the
Information and Privacy Commissioner. It can also be of assistance in processing subsequent
similar requests (see OIPC Order 99-011)
http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/99-011.pdf.

The 30 day time period for responding to requests starts on the day after receipt of a request
in the office of the custodian designated to receive such request. In a large or decentralized
custodian, this would normally be the office of the Health Information Coordinator. A request
may be delivered to any office of a custodian during normal business hours, but the time
limit for responding does not start until the request is received in an office authorized to
receive requests.

Custodians need to have a reasonable system in place to ensure that requests are forwarded
immediately to the office(s) designated to receive and begin processing them.

Reasonable steps might include special forwarding instructions to staff in mail rooms within
the custodian and to staff who open the mail, as well as use of a color-coded transmittal file
to indicate the priority and important nature of the request. Staff should be made aware of
the urgent nature of requests under the Health Information Act and the need to forward them
immediately to the Health Information Coordinator or person designated as responsible for
responding to requests.

Once the request is received in the authorized office, it should be date-stamped.

Custodians may establish an automated or manual tracking system depending upon the
volume of work generated by requests under the Act. Tracking systems help ensure that the
time periods under the Act are complied with and keep track of progress in responding to a
request. Automated systems are not normally needed unless a custodian receives more than 50
requests annually or the custodian is decentralized and there is a need to coordinate responses.
Database management software, such as Microsoft Access, could be used to develop an
automated tracking system for requests.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 2.5.13  MAINTAINING COPIES OF REQUESTS AND RECORDS

BEST PRACTICE: Custodians should keep a file for each request processed under the Act. This file
should include:

•	 all	internal	and	external	correspondence,	including	a	copy	of	the	original	request	from	the

applicant, any notices sent to the applicant and any other correspondence from the applicant;

•	 an	unmarked	copy	of	the	records	retrieved	and	reviewed	in	response	to	a	request;

•	 a	copy	of	the	documents	released	to	the	applicant,	either	severed	or	complete;	and

•	 any	other	information	documenting	the	request	management	process.

This practice helps support the custodian in any review by the Information and Privacy
Commissioner, and in making decisions regarding requests for the same or similar records in
the future. However, unless the new request is made shortly after the original, there is still a
need to review the records again (see OIPC Order 99-021 http://www.oipc.ab.ca).

Any requests for access submitted by an individual, and any correspondence related to requests
for access, should be provided in response to future requests for access if the individual is
requesting “all records”, or the “complete file”. In Order H2005-004 the applicant became
suspicious when previous letters he had provided the health region requesting access to his
health records were not provided when he requested access to “all documents” in his file. If the
custodian is not sure if the applicant is interested in receiving these documents in response to
an access request, this could be clarified with the individual prior to processing the request.

The passage of time and any changes in the context surrounding the records may result in
more information being released. Each request needs to be processed as a separate request and
decisions need to be made in relation to the particular circumstances that apply at the time of
the request.

This does not mean that every request is unique. There may be similar types of requests that
lend themselves to categorization and simple release mechanisms. It may be possible to create
easily severed documentation that is then released routinely to the individual it is about.

 2.5.14  CLOSURE AND RETENTION OF REQUEST FILES

It is a good practice to keep a request file active for at least 60 days after responding to a
request in order to allow time for a request for a review by the Commissioner. If a review is
requested, the file will be reopened and remain open until the review process is complete.

Once the file is closed, either because the custodian has responded to the request, a review has
been completed, or a request has been declared to be abandoned, the custodian must retain
the request file for the period of time authorized by its retention and disposition schedule.
Custodians must not transfer, store or destroy request records except in accordance with
such authorization.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 2.6

ABANDONMENT OF REQUESTS

Sometimes applicants will indicate in writing or by telephone an intention not to proceed
with a request. This may be because they have found that the information is available to
them outside the access request process under the Act or because they no longer need
the information.

However, an applicant may simply cease to respond during the processing of a request.
When this situation occurs, section 9 sets out the provisions for declaring a request to be
abandoned. The custodian must have contacted the applicant in writing, and either sought
further information necessary to process the request, or requested payment of or agreement to
pay a fee.

If the applicant does not respond within 30 days of being contacted, the public body may
advise the applicant, in writing, that the request has been declared abandoned as of a specific
date. This notice must state that the applicant can ask for a review of the decision by the
Commissioner.

In some cases, an applicant abandons a request after processing is completed. If the custodian:

 • has responded to the applicant’s request, stating where, when and how access will

be given;

 • has requested that the applicant contact the custodian about viewing the records; and
 • the applicant does not respond within 30 days,

the custodian may advise the applicant that the request has been declared abandoned.

The file should be kept active for a further 60 days in order to allow time for the applicant to
request a review by the Commissioner.

Model Letter D in Appendix 2 deals with this type of situation.

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

THI NGS TO REMEMB ER

ACCESS TO AN INDIVIDUAL’S OWN HEALTH INFORMATION

 • An individual has a right of access to any record containing health

information about the individual that is in the custody or under the control
of a custodian, subject to the payment of any required fees and subject to the
custodian being authorized or required to refuse access under section 11 of
the Act.

 • “Custody” means having possession of the health record or information and

having the right to deal with the record.

 • “Control” means having the authority to manage the health record or

information by such things as restricting, regulating and administering its use,
disclosure or disposition.

 • If a custodian has another procedure for an individual to access his/her own
health information, the individual may choose to use the existing procedure.

 • The access request process under Part 2 of the Act may be used by an

individual who has not been able to use an access process outside the Act or
who has not been satisfied with the amount or kind of information received
through another process.

 • The Act does not prevent or limit the use of legal processes to gather

information about a part in a legal action and the Act does not override the
power of a court in Canada to compel a witness to testify or a custodian to
produce documents.

 • A request for access to an individual’s own health information may be written
or non-written depending upon the policy of the custodian. The Request to
Access Information Form (in Appendix 1 of this Publication) may be used.

 • An individual’s right of access may be exercised by an authorized

representative, such as a parent, guardian, executor, etc., with documented
authority (section 104(1)(c) to (h)). An individual may give written
authorization to another person to act on his/her behalf (under section 104(1)
(i)) or by using an Authorization of Representative Form (sample in Appendix
1 of this Publication).

 • A custodian must ensure that the identity of the applicant or the applicant’s

representative is authentic.

THINGS TO REMEMBER

CHAPTER TWO – An Individual’s Access To Own Health Information

 • If a custodian is subject to both the Health Information Act and the FOIP Act
and receives a request for access to an individual’s personal information,
the rules under the Health Information Act would apply to accessing the
individual’s own health information and the rules under the FOIP Act would
apply to accessing the individual’s other personal information.

 • A custodian may charge an applicant the fees in the Schedule under the

Health Information Regulation but may also excuse the applicant from paying
all or part of the fees. The fees in the Schedule are intended to be maximums.
Custodians may charge applicants less than the amounts in the Schedule.

 • A request for access to an individual’s own health information must be

completed within 30 calendar days unless the time limit has been extended in
accordance with the Act.

For help in processing a request, refer to the Model Health Information Act Access
Request Chart for a list of key tasks and timelines; to the Model Letters for responding

Exceptions to the Right of Access to an
Individual’s Own Health Information

 3.1

OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER THREE

This Chapter will cover:

 • the meaning of the right to refuse an individual’s request to access their own health

information;

 • the meaning of “harm”;
 • how a custodian “exercises its discretion” in applying the exceptions to disclosure;
 • the discretionary exceptions; and
 • the mandatory exceptions.

 3.1.1

RIGHT OF ACCESS SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC AND LIMITED EXCEPTIONS

Section 2(d) provides individuals with a right of access to health information about
themselves, subject to limited and specific exceptions as set out in the Act. These exceptions
are set out in section 11.

Although custodians are authorized and in some cases, required to refuse access to a record or
to a portion of a record, a basic principle of the Act is to give individuals access to their own
health information. Any exceptions to this right of access should be applied in a limited and
specific way to provide individuals as much access to their information as possible. Refusal
to disclose all or part of a record will occur only where there is a specified exception to the
disclosure that is supported by a provision of the Act.

Each record must be carefully reviewed to determine if there is harm in releasing certain
information in the record; whether this harm qualifies for an exception under the Act; or
whether disclosure would reveal a certain class of information that falls within an exception.

Custodians should interpret the exceptions narrowly. This means that there must be a
reasonable expectation that an exception applies, and only the specific information that is
subject to the exception will be withheld.

In some cases more than one exception may apply to all or part of a record. A custodian should
take into account all relevant factors when considering an exception to an applicant’s right
of access.

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

Refusal of access to an individual’s own health information is a common basis for requests for
review to the Information and Privacy Commissioner under section 73. Custodians should be
prepared to document and defend their decision not to disclose particular information.

Discretionary Exceptions
The exceptions in section 11(1)(a) – (e) start with the phrase “a custodian may refuse to
disclose health information”. They permit a custodian to disclose a record despite the existence
of the exception. There are five discretionary exceptions:

 • if the disclosure could reasonably be expected to result in immediate and grave harm to the
applicant’s mental or physical health or safety, to threaten the mental or physical health or
safety of another individual or to pose a threat to public safety

 • if the disclosure could reasonably lead to the identification of a person who provided

health information to the custodian explicitly or implicitly in confidence and in
circumstances in which it was appropriate that the name of the person who provided the
information to be kept confidential;

 • if the disclosure could reasonably be expected to reveal advice, proposals,

recommendations, analyses or policy options developed by or for a member of the
Executive Council or consultations or deliberations involving a member or the Executive
Council or the member’s staff

 • if the disclosure could reasonably be expected to reveal advice, proposals,

recommendations, analyses or policy options developed by or for a custodian referred to in
section 1(1)(f)(iii), (iv) or (vii); or

 • if the information relates to procedures or techniques relating to audits to be conducted or
diagnostic tests or assessments to be given, details of specific audits to be conducted or of
specific tests or assessments to be given, standardized diagnostic tests or assessments used
by a custodian, including intelligence tests.

Discretionary exceptions require two decisions by a custodian:

 • a determination as to whether a record comes within the description of records potentially

subject to being withheld from disclosure; and

 • the exercise of discretion by a custodian must be made as to whether the record should still

be disclosed even though it might qualify for the exception.

See section 3.3 of this Chapter for a discussion of the Discretionary Exceptions.

Mandatory Exceptions
The exceptions in sections 11(2)(a) –(d) start with the phrase “a custodian must refuse to
disclose”. If information falls within a mandatory exception, a custodian must refuse to disclose
all or part of the record as required. There are four mandatory exceptions:

 • if the health information is about an individual other than the applicant, unless the health
information was originally provided by a custodian who could pass this on to another
custodian in the context of a health service being provided to the applicant

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

 • if the health information sets out procedures or contains results of an investigation,

a discipline proceeding, a practice review or an inspection relating to a health
services provider

 • if the health information would reveal the substance of deliberations of the Executive
Council or any of its committees or of the Treasury Board or any of its committees,
including any advice, recommendation, policy consideration or draft legislation or
regulations submitted or prepared for submission to the Executive Council or any of
its committees or to the Treasury Board or any of its committees, unless the health
information has been in existence for 15 years or more, is part of a record of a decision
made by the Executive Council or any of its committees on an appeal under an Act or
is part of a record that presents background facts to the Executive Council or any of its
committees or to the Treasury Board or any of its committees for consideration in making a
decision where the decision has been made public, the decision has been implemented or
5 years or more have passed since the decision was made or considered; or

 • if the disclosure is prohibited by another enactment of Alberta.

See section 3.4 of this Chapter for a discussion of the Mandatory Exceptions.

 3.1.2  MEANING OF HARM

“Harm” means loss or detriment. Each exception is designed to prevent the occurrence of
particular “harms”.

Many discretionary exceptions are based on applying a “harms test”. This means that access to
all or part of a record may be refused if providing access could reasonably be expected to harm
a particular public or private interest.

Three general factors should be taken into account in making a judgment as to harm.

In Order H2002-001 the Privacy Commissioner adopted a harms test as criteria for determining
if a disclosure could “threaten the mental or physical health or safety of another individual”
(section 11(1)(a)(ii)). The harms test was originally developed in Order 96-003 (a FOIP order).

 • There must be a reasonable expectation of probable harm;
 • The harm must constitute damage or detriment, and not mere inconvenience; and
 • There must be a casual connection between disclosure and the anticipated harm.

Further criteria were adopted:

 • There must be evidence of a direct and specific threat to a person and a specific harm

flowing from the disclosure of the information (see Order F2001-010) and

 • There must be detailed evidence to show that the threat and disclosure of the information
are connected and that there is a probability that the threat will occur if the information is
disclosed (see Order 96-004). http://www.oipc.ab.ca

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

Custodians should also consider the following:

 • The harm must be specific: To qualify, it must be possible to identify the detrimental effect
with the actual party whom, or the actual interest which, will suffer harm. The loss or
injury cannot be a vague, general harm.

 • The harm must be current: To qualify, it must be possible to identify the detrimental effect
at the time the exception is claimed or in the foreseeable future. Records which have been
protected from disclosure in the past should be reassessed when a new request is received
to ensure that the harm is still a factor.

The harm must be probable: To qualify, there must be a reasonable likelihood of the
harm occurring.

Some of the factors that will impact a potential harm:
–  the timing of the request;
–  the context of the request;
–  the value of the information to the custodian;
–  the public availability of the information; and
–  the confidentiality of the information.

(See OIPC Practice Note #1 – applying “Harms” Tests, May 1996).
http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/PN1.pdf

 3.1.3

REVEALING A CLASS OF RECORDS

A few discretionary exceptions are based on preventing a class of record from being revealed
rather than on preventing the occurrence of a particular harm. For example, a custodian may
refuse to disclose all or part of a record containing advice, proposals, recommendations,
analyses or policy options developed by or for a member of the Executive Council. In such
cases, there is no need to address the harm that the disclosure may entail.

 3.1.4

EXERCISING DISCRETION

The exercise of discretion requires that the custodian determine whether harm is likely to result
from the release of information that falls within the exception or, if the exception does not have
a harms test, whether the interest outlined in the exception should be protected. If no harm
is apparent or the particular interest is not adversely affected, the custodian should release
the information.

The custodian must take into account all the relevant circumstances of the request and any
advice obtained either from officials within the custodian or from other custodians or other
concerned parties in determining whether or not information that qualifies for a discretionary
exception can be disclosed.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

The exercise of discretion should be:

 • reasonable;
 • adapted to the circumstances; and
 • non-discriminatory.

In a review situation, the Information and Privacy Commissioner will decide whether an
exception applies in a particular circumstance. However, if a discretionary exception has been
properly applied, the Commissioner is not likely to overrule the custodian’s decision. The
Commissioner can, however, order that discretion be exercised properly, where it appears that
this responsibility is being disregarded or done without due care and diligence.

A custodian must not replace the exercise of discretion with a blanket policy that information
will not be released if it falls within an exception. However, guidelines can be developed to
help guide the exercise of discretion, provided they are not interpreted as binding rules.

Some factors that should be taken into account when exercising discretion include:

 • the general purposes of the legislation;
 • the wording of the discretionary exception and the interests which the exception attempts

to balance;

 • whether the applicant’s request could be satisfied by severing the record and by providing

the applicant with as much information as is reasonably practicable;

 • the historical practice of the organization with respect to the release of similar types

of records;

 • the age of the record; and
 • whether previous Commissioner’s orders have ruled that similar types of records or

information should be disclosed.

(See OIPC Order 96-017) http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/96-017.pdf

 3.1.5  APPLICATION OF EXCEPTIONS AND RESPONSE TO APPLICANT

The basic steps in applying exceptions are:

Step 1: Preliminary Examination
Review the record(s) to determine which exceptions may apply and to gauge the complexity of
the request.

Step 2:   Detailed Review
Review the record(s) line by line to thoroughly consider the nature and extent of the exceptions
involved, including mandatory exceptions where the custodian has no discretion to disclose
information and identification of information where no exception applies.

Step 3: Exercise of Discretion
Where discretion is permitted, decide whether all or part of the information subject to the
exception will be released or refused.

Step 4: Severing
Sever the part of the record(s) to which the custodian has decided that it is necessary to refuse
access. This will leave the record with blank spaces.

Step 5: Response to Applicant
Prepare a response to the applicant following the guidelines provided in Chapter 2 of
this publication.

 3.2

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ACTS

Inconsistency or Conflict with Another Enactment

Section 4 states that if a provision of the Health Information Act is inconsistent or in conflict
with a provision of another Act or regulation, the provisions of the Health Information Act
prevail unless another Act, or a regulation under the Health Information Act, expressly provides
that the other Act or regulation, or a provision of it, prevails over the Health Information Act.

Some acts have specific provisions that prevail over the Health Information Act
(e.g., section 21(3) of the Fatality Inquiries Act).

When considering records that might be excepted under section 4, a custodian has to be sure
that the record(s) being reviewed have a direct relationship to the provision that prevails
(see OIPC Order 98-007). http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/98-007.pdf

If the Commissioner finds that a provision of the Health Information Act is inconsistent or
in conflict with another enactment, and the other enactment is one that prevails, he has no
jurisdiction over the information with respect to that provision (see OIPC Order 99-034).
http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/99-034.pdf

(See the discussion of Inconsistency or Conflict with Another Enactment under section 1.6 in
Chapter 1 of this Publication)

Alberta Ombudsman
Under section 94 of the Health Information Act, the Alberta Ombudsman may not investigate
any matter that the Privacy Commissioner has the power to investigate or review unless
the Commissioner agrees. As of September 1, 2006 the Alberta Ombudsman can investigate
concerns related to decisions, recommendations, actions or omissions in the patient concerns
resolution processes of a regional health authority, if they are not under the jurisdiction of the
Privacy Commissioner. This would be for concerns not related to the Health Information Act or
FOIP. An investigation by the Ombudsman is the final step in the process after other resolution
measures have been pursued.

Deemed Requests Under the FOIP Act
For a discussion of the relationship between requests under the Health Information Act and
requests under the FOIP Act, see section 2.4.6 of Chapter 2 of this Publication (section 16 of
the Health Information Act).

Copyright Act
Section 32.1 of the Copyright Act (Canada) states that disclosure of a record pursuant to the
Access to Information Act (Canada),or disclosure of personal information pursuant to the
Privacy Act (Canada), or disclosure pursuant to any similar Act of the legislature of a province,
does not constitute an infringement of copyright.

Although this is unlikely to occur, custodians would not infringe copyright by disclosing
copyrighted material in response to a request for health information under the Health
Information Act.

 3.3

DISCRETIONARY EXCEPTIONS

 3.3.1  DISCLOSURE EXPECTED TO HARM OR THREATEN THE APPLICANT’S OR
ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL’S MENTAL OR PHYSICAL HEALTH OR SAFETY OR
POSE A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY

Section 11(1)(a) provides a custodian with discretion to refuse to disclose health information to
an applicant if the disclosure could reasonably be expected to:

 • result in immediate and grave harm to the applicant’s mental or physical health or safety;
 • threaten the mental or physical health or safety of another individual; or
 • pose a threat to public safety.

The criteria for the harms test were used in OIPC Order H2002-001 (para 18) and in
subsequent OIPC Orders.

“Immediate and grave harm” means something that would cause very serious physical or
mental trauma to an applicant or would pose considerable danger to the safety of an applicant.
The harm would also have to reasonably be expected to occur without delay or within a very
short time after the information is disclosed.

“Threaten” means to expose to risk or harm.

“Safety” means the relative freedom from danger or risks.

“Mental health” refers to the functioning of a person’s mind in a normal state.

“Physical health” refers to the well-being of an individual’s physical body.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

The following examples may help to illustrate the concept of an individual’s mental or physical
health being threatened.

* If there is information in an applicant’s health record (e.g., informant information) and there
is a good possibility that disclosure of the information to the applicant could cause danger or
harm to the informant, the custodian may wish to apply this exception.

* If an individual with a long history of mental instability who might suffer serious mental and
physical trauma if a certain diagnosis were made available to him or her without the benefit of
medical or mental health intervention.

* In determining whether such a threat exists, a duly qualified person (physician, chartered
psychologist, psychiatrist or other appropriate expert) (who might also be the custodian of the
information) could exercise his or her judgment about the potential for harm to occur.

Refer to section 3.1.2 in this publication for the criteria for “harm” used by the OIPC.

In the case of a request for records made to a custodian with many affiliates and facilities,
it could consult with its own health professional staff or a duly qualified health professional
external to the custodian to determine whether there was any known threat to the mental or
physical health or safety of another individual.

“Pose a threat to public safety” means that the disclosure of information could present a risk to
the safety and security of the public at large.

Burden of Proof
The custodian has the burden of proof to show that one or more of the exceptions to the right
of access applies and that the applicant should not have access to his or her health records.
The evidence provided should be more than a general statement from a health professional
indicating that providing the applicant with his or her own health information would pose a
threat to the individual’s mental or physical health or safety, another individual’s health or
safety, or pose a threat to public safety.

Evidence to support the decision not to provide the individual with his or her own health
information, or a portion of his or her own health information, should be provided. This might
include documentation or observations of past behavior of the individual in relevant situations,
statements the individual made in the past, a pattern of behavior discernible in his or her
health records, or other details that might indicate a reasonable expectation of harm to the
individual, another person, or a threat to public safety.

In OIPC Order H2002-001 the Privacy Commissioner applied the harms test adopted in Order
2001-010. There is the requirement for a reasonable expectation of probable harm, harm that
is damage or detriment rather than mere inconvenience, and a causal connection between the
disclosure and the anticipated harm. See OIPC Orders F2004-005 and H2004-001, H2003-001,
and H2002-001. (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

BEST PRACTICE: If a custodian feels that the disclosure of certain information could result in the
harms specified in this exception, the custodian should make an effort to provide the applicant
with as much health information as possible by using an appropriate health services provider
to explain the meaning of the information to the individual or to put it into context with the
individual’s other health information.

Threat to Another Individual
In OIPC Order F2004-005 and H2004-001 the applicant requested his mental health records
from three hospitals in a particular health region. The health region provided 549 pages of
records but withheld the names, initials, signatures, position titles, professional designations
and credentials about other individuals in the health, justice, law enforcement, corrections, and
legal systems. The health authority stated that the information withheld could reasonably be
expected to threaten the mental or physical health or safety of other individuals, and provided
an affidavit from a psychiatrist who stated that all identifiers should be removed prior to
providing records to the applicant. He further stated that there was a reasonable expectation of
harm if the severing were not done, and that the harm would be quite serious, “and even grave”,
and that there was a clear and direct connection between the disclosure and the anticipated
harm. The affidavit was general and did not present evidence to back up the assertions. The
medical records themselves, however, had statements made numerous times that did indicate
the individual could be violent towards those in the health, justice, and law enforcement areas.
The records reveal a pattern of behaviour.

The Applicant did not appear to be pursuing the information to learn about his own health
information, but to pursue his perceived injustices against all individuals who would be
identified through his records.

This is a discretionary decision. If the custodian decides not to disclose, “it must show that it
considered the objects and purposes of the Health Information Act and did not exercise its
discretion for an irrelevant or improper purpose”.

The Commissioner found that the health region had properly applied the harms test in
section 11(1)(a)(ii) of the Health Information Act to the information it withheld.

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

 3.3.2  DISCLOSURE LEADING TO IDENTIFICATION OF A CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE

OF HEALTH INFORMATION

Under section 11(1)(b) a custodian may refuse to disclose health information (e.g., registration
information) that could reasonably lead to the identification of a person who provided health
information to the custodian explicitly or implicitly in confidence. To fit within the exception,
the person who provided the health information must also have done so in circumstances
where it would be appropriate that the name of the person be kept confidential.

The exception does not require a custodian to demonstrate that harm could come to the source
but must make a determination, based on the relevant circumstances, that it is appropriate to
protect the identity of the source.

“Identity” includes the name and any identifying characteristics, symbols and numbers relating
to the source.

A “confidential source” is someone who supplies health information, as defined in the Act,
to a custodian on the assurance that his or her identity will remain secret. Affiliates cannot
be “sources” because they are employees or contractors of a custodian and are supplying
information as part of their job (see OIPC Order 99-010). http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/
upload/99-010.pdf

“Explicitly” means that there is written or other documentary evidence that indicates that the
information was supplied on the understanding that it would be kept confidential.

“Implicitly” means that both parties understand the confidentiality even though there may
be no actual statement, written agreement or other physical evidence of the understanding.
All relevant facts and circumstances need to be examined to determine whether there is an
understanding of confidentiality.

“In confidence” usually describes a situation of mutual trust in which private matters are
related or reported.

Some factors that may be considered when determining whether information was supplied
explicitly or implicitly in confidence are:

 • whether there is documentary evidence indicating that confidentiality exists;
 • the representations of the source as to his or her understanding of confidentiality;
 • past practice of the custodian, particularly whether similar information has normally been

kept confidential in the past;

 • the confidentiality with which it is maintained by the source;
 • whether the information was supplied voluntarily; at the request of the custodian; or as

required by law, and the consequences for the source if it does not supply the information;
and

 • actions taken by, or conduct of, the custodian and the source, which may indicate an

understanding of confidentiality.

(Taken from OIPC Order 97-013 http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/97-013.pdf which, in
the context of section 16(1)(b) of the FOIP Act, interprets what supplied “in confidence” means)

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

It is not sufficient to accept a stamp marked “Confidential” on a document from a source
or a statement by the source that information was supplied in confidence. There must also
be supporting evidence to prove that the information has been treated consistently in a
confidential manner.

OIPC Order 96-020 http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/96-020.pdf discusses the
confidentiality of informant information in the context of a report made to the Health
Facilities Review Committee.

Where a custodian can demonstrate that the source is confidential and is supplying health
information, it then determines whether the information requested by the applicant could
permit the applicant or anyone else to identify the source. Since it may be difficult to determine
whether information can be linked to provide identification, caution should be exercised in
releasing any information connected to a confidential source.

In determining whether it would be “appropriate in the circumstances” not to disclose
the name of the source, a custodian would have to look at all the circumstances in which
the health information was provided. This would include weighing any policy reasons for
maintaining confidentiality and deciding whether the public interest, in this instance, favored
disclosure or non-disclosure.

In OIPC Order H2006-002 the Commissioner examined a custodian’s decision to sever one
and a half pages from the applicant’s health record that it provided in response to a request for
access. The Commissioner agreed with the custodian’s application of section 11(1)(b) of the
Health Information Act, which allows a custodian to refuse to provide access if the information
could lead to the identification of a person who provided health information to the custodian
in confidence if it is appropriate to keep the name of the person confidential. It can be a case of
the source providing the information either explicitly or implicitly in confidence.

There was information in the applicant’s record indicating that he could become agitated and
aggressive, and had paranoid delusions. The records also stated that the applicant expressly
objected to the custodian obtaining information from other individuals. The custodian and
the person who provided the information did not tell the applicant about the information
the person provided. The OIPC therefore determined that the information had been given
implicitly in confidence, and that providing the information to the applicant would have
allowed the applicant to determine the identity of the informant. Under the circumstances, the
OIPC confirmed the custodian’s decision to refuse to grant access to all of the information it
had withheld.

See also OIPC Order 2002-001, (para. 49)  (http://www.oipc.ab.ca).

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

 3.3.3  DISCLOSURE REVEALING ADVICE DEVELOPED BY OR FOR CONSULTATIONS

INVOLVING A MEMBER OF EXECUTIVE COUNCIL

Section 11(1)(c) provides for a custodian to refuse to disclose health information if the
disclosure could reasonably be expected to reveal:

 • advice, proposals, recommendations, analyses or policy options developed by or for a

member of the Executive Council; or

 • consultations or deliberations involving a member of the Executive Council or the

member’s staff.

“Executive Council” means the group of Ministers and the Premier commonly known as the
provincial Cabinet.

A “member of Executive Council” would be the Premier of Alberta, the Provincial Treasurer,
the Ministers and the Associate Ministers.

This discretionary exception is intended to protect:

 • the provision of advice by officials of the department to the Minister or to another member

of Executive Council: and

 • consultations or deliberations that may take place, involving the Minister or another

member of Executive Council and a member of their staff.

It is intended to provide a “deliberative space” for those involved in providing advice, carrying
on consultations and making recommendations so that records may be written with candor and
cover all options.

This “deliberative space” is important for those involved in the policy making process. There is
a need to preserve the relationship between members of Executive Council and those advising
them as part of the overall accountability of custodians. A member of Executive Council may
accept or reject the advice or recommendations developed by or for him or her and that person
must be able to defend that decision.

Discretion is exercised by determining whether or not disclosure of a particular record or part
of a record could reasonably be expected to reveal particular information about either the
deliberative process itself or the matters being discussed. Release of information could also
reveal the deliberative process implicitly if it allows an accurate inference to be made about
that process.

The exercise of discretion should be based on the impact the disclosure can reasonably be
expected to have on the custodian’s ability to carry out similar internal decision-making
processes in the future.

Consideration should be given to whether disclosure of the information in this instance would:

 • make advisory processes less candid and comprehensive;
 • make consultations or deliberations less frank; or
 • hamper the policy-making process.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

These determinations can only be made on a case by case basis, bearing in mind the
magnitude of the process involved, the procedures for decision-making that have been
followed, and the sensitivity of the particular information. A custodian should take into
account the effect that disclosure would have on all steps of a decision-making process, not just
the immediate interests regarding the particular information in question.

Advice, Proposals, Recommendations, Analyses or Policy Options
Section 11(1)(c)(i) is intended to protect candor in the giving of advice and formulation of
proposals, analyses, policy options, recommendations, and related alternatives for potential
courses of action that are developed by or for a member of the Executive Council.

It provides a zone of confidentiality around the policy-making process, rather than protecting
all forms of advice (see OIPC Order 99-001).
http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/ACF2F8.pdf

It applies to advice and recommendations obtained both from outside and inside the custodian,
including those received under a contractual or other advisory arrangement.

“Recommendations” refers to formal recommendations about courses of action to be followed
which are usually specific in nature and are proposed mainly in connection with a particular
decision being made.

“Advice” refers to less formal suggestions about particular approaches to take or courses of
action to follow.

“Proposals, Analyses or Policy Options” refer to the setting out of the advantages and
disadvantages of particular courses of action.

“Member of Executive Council” would be a member of what is commonly known as the
provincial Cabinet. The members consist of the Premier, the Provincial Treasurer, the Ministers
and Associate Ministers.

Note that section 11(1)(c)(i) applies to advice given to the Premier, a Minister or Associate
Minister acting alone. This discretionary exception is not to be confused with the mandatory
exception related to revealing the substance of deliberations of Executive Council in
section 11(2)(c).

The Information and Privacy Commissioner has defined these various terms as types of advice.
The Commissioner’s criteria for “advice” are that it should be:

 • sought or expected, or be part of the responsibility of a person by virtue of that

person’s position;

 • directed toward taking an action, including making a decision; and
 • made to someone who can take or implement the action.

(See OIPC Order 96-006 http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/96-006.pdf for further
explanation of the definition of advice).

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

The Commissioner has determined that a statement of fact that is not directed toward action to
be taken does not qualify as advice under this provision (see OIPC Order 97-007).
http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/97-007.pdf

However, if the factual information is sufficiently interwoven with other advice that it cannot
reasonably be considered separate or distinct, it qualifies under this exception (see OIPC
Order 99-001). http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/ACF2F8.pdf

This exception would not normally apply to the details of a study or background paper where
factual information is presented. It is intended to apply to the information used to formulate
possible directions in dealing with an issue or problem, to establish a policy or to make
a decision.

The nature and significance of certain issues are such that disclosure of advice relating to them
could reveal information that would damage the internal processes of decision-making within
a custodian. Disclosure could also affect its overall ability to effectively manage programs
and activities.

However, there are other issues where more openness surrounding the advisory and decision-
making process can be of benefit. As well, there are also issues and activities of lesser
significance where the disclosure of advice would have little or no effect on the overall
administration or operation of the program or activity.

The wording of the exception in the Health Information Act is not as broad as the wording of
a similar exception in section 24(1)(a) of the FOIP Act. That exception includes advice and
recommendations developed by or for a public body as well as those developed by or for a
member of Executive Council.

Consultations or Deliberations
Section 11(1)(c)(ii) allows a custodian to refuse access to those records or parts of records
containing consultations or deliberations involving a member of Executive Council or the
member’s staff.

A “consultation” is a discussion or consideration where the views of one or more individuals or
groups are sought about the appropriateness of particular proposals or suggested actions.

A “deliberation” is a discussion or consideration by a group of individuals of the reasons for
and against a measure.

This exception would permit the frank exchange of views between a Minister and officials
in his or her department who have been asked to provide advice or who have consultative
responsibilities, or between a Minister and the Minister’s staff.

Consultations and deliberations may involve the exchange of memoranda and proposals or may
be part of agendas and minutes of meetings.

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

Individually identifying health information may have to be included in a briefing note to assist
the Minister in responding to an issue. For example, a member of the public may be seeking
payment for an experimental out-of-country treatment for a particular medical condition.
This may be a complex issue with broader health policy implications and the individually
identifying health information may be relevant to the Minister’s decision.

The wording of the exception in the Health Information Act is not as broad as the wording of
a similar exception in section 24(1)(b) of the FOIP Act. That exception includes consultations
or deliberations involving officers or employees of a public body as well as those involving a
Minister or a Minister’s staff.

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

 3.3.4  DISCLOSURE REVEALING ADVICE DEVELOPED BY OR FOR REGIONAL

HEALTH AUTHORITIES OR PROVINCIAL HEALTH BOARDS

Section 11(1)(d) provides for a custodian to refuse to disclose health information if the
disclosure could reasonably be expected to reveal advice, proposals, recommendations,
analyses or policy options developed by or for the following custodians:

 • a provincial health board established pursuant to regulations made under section 17(1)(a)

of the Regional Health Authorities Act

 • a regional heath authority established under the Regional Health Authorities Act or a

community health council as defined in the Regional Health Authorities Act;

This discretionary exception is similar to the exception in section 11(1)(c) but in this case, it
applies to the deliberative process within the types of custodians listed above. It is intended
to protect candor in the giving of advice and the formulation of proposals, analyses, policy
options, recommendations and related alternatives for potential courses of action that are
developed by or for the custodians listed in the section.

It applies to advice and recommendations obtained both from outside and inside the custodian,
including those received under a contractual or other advisory arrangement.

Discretion is exercised by determining whether disclosure of a particular record or part of
a record could reasonably be expected to reveal particular information about either the
deliberative process itself or the matters being discussed.

Consideration should be given to whether disclosure of the information in this instance would:

 • make advisory processes less candid and comprehensive; or
 • hamper the policy making process.

The exercise of discretion should be based on the impact the disclosure can reasonably be
expected to have on the custodian’s ability to carry out similar internal decision-making
processes in the future.

(For a more detailed discussion on the application of this exception, see Section 3.3.3 of this
Chapter, particularly the portion dealing with the application of section 11(1)(c)(i)).

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

 3.3.5  DISCLOSURE PREJUDICING THE USE OR RESULTS OF AUDITS,

DIAGNOSTIC TESTS OR ASSESSMENTS

Section 11(1)(e) provides that a custodian may refuse to disclose health information if it
relates to:

 • procedures or techniques relating to audits to be conducted or diagnostic tests or

assessments to be given (section 11(1)(e)(i));

 • details of specific audits to be conducted or of specific tests or assessments to be given

(section 11(1)(e)(ii)); or

 • standardized diagnostic tests or assessments used by a custodian, including intelligence

tests (section 11(1)(e)(iii));

and disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to prejudice the use or results
of particular audits, diagnostic tests or assessments.

This is a discretionary exception providing protection for the procedures and techniques
involved in testing and auditing. It also protects details relating to specific tests to be given or
audits to be conducted.

“Audit” means a financial, clinical or other formal or systematic examination or review of a
program, activity or other matter as outlined in the Act (section 1(1)(c)).

“Standardized diagnostic tests and assessments” could include psychological, aptitude or
intelligence tests, among others.

Information is protected where disclosure of a test or audit that is to be conducted, or is
currently in progress, would invalidate the results.

Information is also protected where there is an intention to use the procedure in the future, and
disclosure would result in unreliable results being obtained and the test or audit having to be
abandoned as a result. Test questions that are regularly used may be protected from disclosure.

Information relating to a test or audit that has been used in the past, but which is neither in
progress nor will be used in the future, is not protected by this exception.

The exception applies to testing and auditing carried out both by the custodian and by
consultants and contractors.

If the disclosure could reasonably be expected to prejudice the use or results of particular
audits, diagnostic tests or assessments, custodians should exercise care in disclosing such
results. For example, if revealing the details of a test or audit could lead to inaccurate results
when the test is used in future, a custodian may wish to apply this exception.

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

In OIPC Order H2002-001 the applicant made a request for access to his entire patient record.
The custodian refused to disclose any information, and cited several of the discretionary
exceptions in the Health Information Act to the right of access to health information.

One of the exceptions cited was section 11(1)(e) which allows a custodian to refuse access if
the information relates to diagnostic tests and assessments and the disclosure could reasonably
be expected to prejudice the use or results of diagnostic tests or assessments. The custodian
stated that this section applied to portions of 22 pages of documents. The information related
to diagnostic tests or assessments such as aptitude and personality tests. The information
provided explanations of the purposes and results of the tests as well as test results described
either in raw responses or scaled scores.

The Privacy Commissioner ruled that the individual raw responses, but not other portions of the
health record, could affect the results of subsequent tests and that that portion of the record
could be withheld.  (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

Custodians should exercise care in disclosing the results of diagnostic tests or audits by
ensuring that a professional familiar with the tests is available to explain and interpret
them to the applicant. This process should be dealt with as part of a custodian’s policies
and procedures.

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

 3.4

MANDATORY EXCEPTIONS

 3.4.1  DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL OTHER THAN

THE APPLICANT

Section 11(2)(a) requires a custodian to refuse to disclose health information to an applicant
if the health information is about an individual other than the applicant, unless the health
information was originally provided by the applicant in the context of a health service being
provided to the applicant.

If all or part of the information requested by the applicant falls within this exception, the
custodian has no discretion to disclose the information.

This mandatory exception is different than the mandatory exception regarding disclosure of
third party personal information in section 17(1) of the FOIP Act. Section 11(2)(a) of the
Health Information Act does not require a custodian to determine whether the disclosure of
health information would be an unreasonable invasion of another individual’s personal privacy.

Section 11(2)(a) is more categorical. If health information about another individual is part
of the record(s) requested by an applicant, and the health information was not provided by
the applicant in the context of a health service being provided to the applicant, the custodian
would have to sever that information from the record before the record was disclosed to
the applicant.

There may be situations where an applicant has provided health information about family
members or other relatives to his or her physician in the context of providing a medical history.
The information about other individuals provided by the applicant as part of their medical
history, could be disclosed to the applicant requesting access to his or her health information.

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

 3.4.2  DISCLOSURE OF PROCEDURES OR RESULTS OF AN INVESTIGATION OF

A HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDER

Section 11(2)(b) creates a mandatory exception for the disclosure of information that sets out
procedures or contains the results of an investigation, a discipline proceeding, a practice review
or an inspection relating to a health services provider.

“Investigation” refers to a systematic process of examination, inquiry and observation.

“Discipline proceeding” refers to a formal process of determining whether a practitioner has
displayed a lack of skill or judgment in the practice of his or her profession; has displayed
unbecoming and/or unprofessional, disgraceful or dishonourable conduct; or is incapable or
unfit to practice his or her profession.

“Practice review” refers to an assessment or evaluation of the professional performance or
competence of a practitioner.

“Inspection” refers to the examination or viewing of the physical premises or of the books,
records, papers or other documents of a practitioner as part of an investigation.

“Procedures” refers to the methods and processes by which the examinations, inquiries
and observations are carried out and include the equipment and technology employed in
those activities.

Both the procedures and the results of an investigation of a health services provider, or of a
discipline proceeding, a practice review or an inspection relating to a health services provider
fall within this mandatory exception.

Refusal to disclose information that sets out the procedures for such activities relates to the
need to maintain the continued effectiveness of the investigative techniques and procedures
used or likely to be used in the investigative activity.

The results of investigations or disciplinary proceedings, etc. involving a health services
provider are not disclosed because the disciplinary processes and disclosure of information
about them are governed by other professional legislation such as the Health Professions Act.
Those processes are carried out by the provider’s professional association.

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

In OIPC Order H2002-002 the applicant requested access to correspondence about an internal
review conducted after the applicant had made a complaint about a surgeon. The custodian
provided access to some information, but the applicant wanted access to a two page letter
which the custodian refused. The regional health authority refused access on the basis that it
contained practice review information and must not be disclosed pursuant to section 11(2)(b)
of the Health Information Act.

The record had been prepared after the applicant had made his complaint. In an affidavit
provided, the custodian stated that the complaint was handled as a practice review.

The applicant complained that the custodian had no formal criteria as to what constitutes a
practice review, however the Privacy Commissioner noted that the Health Information Act does
not require one. “Practice review” in the context of the Health Information Act includes activities
involved in the review of the quality of health services provided by a health services provider.

The Privacy Commissioner found that the entire record contained the results of a practice
review relating to a health services provider. The Privacy Commissioner therefore upheld the
custodian’s decision not to disclose the record to the applicant.

See OIPC Order H2004-003 for another example of discussion of a practice review. The records
at issue in this case were incident reports which the custodian refused to provide in response to
a request for access.

Order F2006-021 and H2006-001 also involves incident reports, discussion of a practice review
and right of access. (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

 3.4.3  DISCLOSURE REVEALING SUBSTANCE OF DELIBERATIONS OF

EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OR TREASURY BOARD

Section 11(2)(c) creates a mandatory exception that prohibits the disclosure of health
information that would reveal the substance of deliberations of the Executive Council or any of
its committees or of the Treasury Board or any of its committees.

The information subject to the exception includes any advice, recommendations, policy
considerations or draft legislation or regulations submitted or prepared for submission to the
Executive Council or any of its committees or to the Treasury Board or any of its committees.

“Advice, recommendations” refers to the analysis and presentation of various options for a
suggested course of action that is the subject of deliberation. The advice or recommendation
must deal with issues that will be, are or have been discussed by the Executive Council,
Treasury Board or one of the committees of either body.

“Policy considerations” refers to analysis and flagging of issues that deserve special
consideration by ministers when taking action or making policy decisions at Executive Council,
Treasury Board or a committee of either.

“Executive Council” means the group of Ministers and the Premier acting collectively as
the provincial Cabinet. This exception does not apply to a minister acting alone, unless the
individual minister is carrying out the direction of Cabinet or is acting as a Cabinet committee.

“Committees of Executive Council or Cabinet committees and committees of the Treasury
Board” include the Agenda and Priorities Committee, Treasury Board committees and other ad
hoc committees struck to deal with specific issues.

This exception is based on the convention of collective ministerial responsibility to the
Legislature and to Albertans for the actions of the government. In order to facilitate this
collective decision-making, Cabinet discussions and deliberations have traditionally been kept
confidential. This permits full and frank discussions.

There may also be situations where Cabinet may wish to delay public announcement of its
decisions. It may have entered into arrangements with affected individuals to postpone an
announcement of a decision until a specific time.

Cabinet may also develop plans to deal with issues, emergencies or contingencies. The value of
these plans would be lessened if immediate access to the plans were granted.

Because section 11(2)(c) deals with the Cabinet process, the Office of the Executive Council
makes all decisions relating to disclosure of submissions to the Executive Council and related
records. Alberta Treasury makes all decisions relating to disclosure of submissions to Treasury
Board and related records. In the case of Treasury Board confidences, this approval requirement
does not extend to records that Treasury Board requires the department to prepare, such as a
business plan.

Consultations regarding these types of records must be conducted with Executive Council, for
Cabinet confidences and with Alberta Treasury, for Treasury Board confidences.

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

Substance of Deliberations
Custodians must determine whether a record or part of a record reveals the substance of the
deliberations of the Executive Council, the Treasury Board or any of their committees, either
explicitly or implicitly.

A release of information “explicitly” reveals the substance of deliberations if the information
itself contains the essence of the discussion or deliberations or reveals the contents of
the deliberations.

A release of information “implicitly” reveals this type of information if it is reasonable to
expect that disclosed information could be combined with other information to reveal the
substance of Executive Council, Treasury Board or their committee deliberations.

“Substance” means the essence or essential part of a deliberation.

“Deliberation” means the act of weighing and examining the reasons for and against a
contemplated act or course of conduct. It also includes an examination of choices of direction
or means to accomplish an objective.

It is possible that special case or precedent setting situations may end up being discussed by
Executive Council from a policy perspective or by Treasury Board from a financial perspective.
While it would generally be possible to discuss these matters using non-identifying health
information, sometimes the high profile public nature of the case (e.g., a person out of country
requesting payment for health-related costs, or a person requesting to travel out of country for
a health service, in unusual circumstances) means that the identity of the individual will be
readily known.

Individuals have a right to access any record containing health information about them.
While an individual’s health records will not be forwarded to Executive Council or
Treasury Board, records may contain references to particular health information about an
identifiable individual.

Examples of Records
Examples of records that would reveal the substance of deliberations of the Executive Council,
Treasury Board or one of their committees are:

 • agendas, minutes and related documents of Executive Council meetings;
 • letters and memoranda concerning issues deliberated upon or the decisions or directions

taken by ministers but not made public which may have been sent to ministerial colleagues
or senior public servants;

 • briefing material, exclusive of background facts, placed before Executive Council, Treasury

Board or one of their committees;

 • a memorandum (including electronic mail) from the Secretary to Cabinet to ministers

discussing Cabinet decisions;

103

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

 • a memorandum (including electronic mail) from a deputy minister to an assistant deputy
minister or chief executive officer or other senior officer dealing with issues that will
be or have been deliberated upon by the Executive Council, Treasury Board or one of
their committees;

 • a record of discussions between senior officials about issues that will be or have been

deliberated upon by the Executive Council, Treasury Board or one of their committees; and

 • a draft or final submission to Executive Council or Treasury Board, excluding

background facts.

When the Exception Does Not Apply
The exception in section 11(2)(c) does not apply where the health information:

 • has been in existence for 15 years or more (11(2)(c)(i));
 • is part of a record of a decision made by the Executive Council or any of its committees on

an appeal under an Act (11(2)(c)(ii)); or

 • is part of a record the purpose of which is to present background facts to the Executive
Council or any of its committees or to the Treasury Board or any of its committees for
consideration in making a decision where:
–  the decision has been made public
–  the decision has been implemented; or
–  5 years or more have passed since the decision was made or considered (11(2)(c)(iii)).

Where the Executive Council or one of its committees functions as an appeal body under an
Act and makes a decision, the decision and any recorded reasons for the decision are available
to the public (11(2)(c)(ii)).

Other portions of the record, such as the advice and recommendations supporting the process
leading to a decision remain subject to section 11(2)(c).

Section 11(2)(c)(iii) permits the release of information prepared specifically with the intent
of presenting factual information to the Executive Council, Treasury Board or any of their
committees where the decision has been made public, it has been implemented or five or more
years have passed since the decision was made or considered.

“Background facts” means facts that provide explanatory or contributory information or
circumstances. These are usually found in attachments to submission documents and are
intended to assist in the Cabinet deliberations.

A “decision has been made public” if it has been communicated to the public in an authorized
way. This would include communication in a statement by a minister, a statement during
Question Period, a presentation in the Legislative Assembly, or a letter, statement or news
release to the media. A “leak” of information is not considered an authorized disclosure
of information.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

A “decision has been implemented” if the decision has been put into effect or acted upon even
if the implementation or action is not complete. A decision is not considered to have been
implemented if it remains subject to approval or is not final.

When a decision is reconsidered, clarified, amended, reversed or delayed, the exception does
not apply to background facts if the decision subsequently reconsidered has either been made
public or implemented. However, other provisions of the Act may prevent disclosure.

In applying section 11(2)(c)(iii), the context in which a record containing background facts
was presented to Executive Council or Treasury Board must be examined. Just because a
decision on a particular subject has been made public does not mean that background facts
respecting a related decision can be disclosed. One must consider what decision was being
deliberated when the background facts were submitted to Cabinet. (See OIPC Order 97-010)).
http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/97-010.pdf

“More than 5 years have passed since the decision was made or considered” means 5
years from a particular month and day to a corresponding month and day 5 years later.
This condition applies regardless of whether a decision has been made public or has
been implemented.

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

 3.4.4  DISCLOSURE PROHIBITED BY ANOTHER ENACTMENT OF ALBERTA

Section 11(2)(d) creates a mandatory exception to the disclosure of health information where
the disclosure would be expressly prohibited by another Alberta act or regulation.

Certain acts and regulations, or sections of acts or regulations may state that they prevail
despite the Health Information Act (see section 11(2)(d)). If another act or regulation or section
of an act or regulation states that the disclosure of certain health information is prohibited,
section 11(2)(d) would require a custodian to refuse to disclose the requested health
information to an applicant.

For another enactment to prevail over the Health Information Act, two criteria must be met
(section 4):

 • Another Act, or a regulation under HIA, must expressly state that the other Act or
regulation, or a provision of it, prevails despite the Health Information Act, and

 • A provision of the Health Information Act must be inconsistent or in conflict with a

provision in the other enactment.

An example of a provision in statutes that prohibit the disclosure of health information
would be:

 • Section 9 of the Alberta Evidence Act, which creates a statutory privilege to prohibit

disclosure of a “quality assurance record” as defined under that Act.

The Alberta Evidence Act prohibits a witness in an action from producing any quality assurance
record in the possession or control of that person or in the possession or control of a quality
assurance committee (section 9(2)(b)).

The Alberta Evidence Act does not apply to original medical and hospital records relating to a
patient (section 9(3) of the Alberta Evidence Act).

A “quality assurance record” includes ‘a record of information in any form that is created
or received by or for a quality assurance committee in the course of or for the purpose of its
carrying out quality assurance activities’ (section 9(1)(c) of the Alberta Evidence Act).

A “quality assurance committee” is defined in the Alberta Evidence Act as a body with the
primary purpose of carrying out quality assurance activities, which is appointed, established or
designated in accordance with subsection 9(1)(b) of that Act.

See OIPC Order H2002-002 for discussion of right of access to practice review information.

It should be noted that a quality assurance record as defined under section 9 of the Alberta
Evidence Act is not a record to which the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act
applies. This means that an applicant that is refused access to a quality assurance record under
the Health Information Act could not successfully make an application for access under the
FOIP Act (section 4(1)(c) of the FOIP Act).

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

In Order H2008-004, the Information and Privacy Commissioner concluded that section 88 of
the HIA did not provide him with the authority to compel a hospital to produce a record of a
quality review completed by the hospital for the purpose of determining the application of the
HIA to the record in the context of an access request.

Incident Reports
An incident report in and of itself is not a quality assurance record. Quality assurance reports
may contain patient records or health information about an individual that has been derived
from an incident report. These records, however, only provide the raw data or material for a
quality assurance report.

An individual making an access request may argue that he or she is entitled to access the
health information contained in an Incident Report, which is in the custody of a custodian
pursuant to section 7(1) of the Health Information Act.

However, a custodian may argue that the main purpose of an Incident Report is to describe
an unexpected incident and prevent future incidents, rather than to describe health services
provided to a particular individual.

The custodian would have the onus or burden of proof to show that the person making the
request has no right of access to the health information.

Some health care facilities keep Incident Reports as a part of the hospital record. The Nursing
Homes Operation Regulation, Alta. Reg. 258/85, has a unique requirement for long term care
facilities to keep notes, although not necessarily incident reports, as part of the resident’s
record (section 11(1)(i)(iii)). This practice and statutory requirement weigh in favor of the
argument that an Incident Report contains health information that should be disclosed to an
individual requesting access.

See OIPC Orders H2004-003, F2006-021 and H2006-001 for discussion on right of access and
incident reports. (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

THI NGS TO REMEMB ER

RIGHT TO REFUSE ACCESS TO HEALTH INFORMATION

Discretionary Exceptions
A custodian may refuse to disclose all or part of the health information in a record that
falls within a discretionary exception under section 11(1) of the Act but must determine
whether the record should be disclosed even though it might qualify for the exception.
The discretionary exceptions are used where disclosure of the information could
reasonably be expected to:

 • harm the mental or physical health or safety of applicant or of another individual;
 • pose a threat to public safety;
 • reveal the identity of a confidential source of health information;
 • reveal advice developed by or for or consultations involving a member of

Executive Council;

 • reveal advice, proposals, recommendations, analyses or policy options development
by or for a custodian referred to by a custodian referred to in section 1(1)(f)(iii), (iv)
or (vii); or

 • prejudice the use or results of audits or tests.

Mandatory Exceptions
A custodian must refuse to disclose all or part of the health information in a record if
the information falls within a mandatory exception under section 11(2) of the Act. The
mandatory exceptions are used where disclosure of the information would:

 • reveal information about individuals other than the applicant;
 • reveal procedures or results of investigation of a health services provider;
 • reveal the substance of deliberations of Executive Council or Treasury Board; or
 • be prohibited by another enactment of Alberta.

Inconsistency or Conflict with Another Enactment
If a provision of the Health Information Act is inconsistent or in conflict with a provision
of another act or regulation, the provision of the Health Information Act prevails unless
the other act or a regulation under the Health Information Act expressly says that the
other act, or regulation or a provision of it, prevails over the Health Information Act
(see Chapter 12 on Paramountcy and Consequential Amendments)

THINGS TO REMEMBER

CHAPTER THREE – Exceptions to the Right of Access to an Individual’s Own Health Information

Applying the Exceptions

 • Review the record(s) to determine if any of the exceptions in the Health Information

Act may apply and to identify information where no exception applies.

 • Review the record(s) to determine if the release of the records is inconsistent or in
conflict with another act or regulation. If the records being reviewed have a direct
relationship to a provision of another act or regulation that expressly prevails over
the Health Information Act, the release of information is subject to the provisions of
the other act.

 • Where discretion is permitted, decide whether all or part of the information subject

to the exception will be released or refused.

 • Sever the part of the record(s) to which the custodian has decided that access needs

to be refused.

 • Prepare a response to the applicant indicating the reason for refusal of all or part of

the requested information.

 • The exercise of discretion must be reasonable and not arbitrary, adapted to the

circumstances of the request at hand, non-discriminatory and consistent.
 • Records should be kept outlining decisions made regarding discretionary

disclosures. This way, if an applicant appeals to the Office of the Information
and Privacy Commissioner, the documentation is ready and will save time for
the custodian.

 • For help in applying the exceptions refer to the flow chart diagrams following the

discussion of each exception in the Manual.

Correction or Amendment
of Health Information

 4.1

OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER FOUR

This Chapter will cover:

 • the meaning of a request for correction or amendment of health information;
 • how an individual may make a request to correct or amend the individual’s own health

information;

 • how a custodian should respond to a request to correct or amend an individual’s health

information;

 • agreeing to make a correction or amendment to health information;
 • refusing to correct or amend health information;
 • time limits for responding to requests;
 • deemed requests under the FOIP Act;
 • administering the correction/amendment process.

 4.2

HOW DOES AN INDIVIDUAL REQUEST A CORRECTION TO, OR
AMENDMENT OF, THE INDIVIDUAL’S HEALTH INFORMATION?

Section 2(d) provides individuals with the right to request correction or amendment of health
information about themselves.

“Correction” refers to the process of removing a mistake or error in a health record and
replacing it with what is correct or accurate.

“Amendment” refers to the process of changing or varying something in a health record.

Under section 13(1), an individual who believes that there is an error or omission in the
individual’s health information may make a written request to the custodian whom he or
she believes has the information in its custody or under its control to correct or amend
the information.

An “error” refers to mistaken or wrong information or information that does not reflect the true
state of affairs.

An “omission” refers to information that is incomplete or missing or that has been overlooked.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FOUR – Correction or Amendment of Health Information

A custodian has “custody” of health information when it is in the possession of the custodian
and the custodian has a right to deal with the information.

A custodian has “control” of health information when it has the authority to manage the
health information in such ways as restricting, regulating and administering its use, disclosure
and disposition.

See Chapter 2, section 2.3 of this Publication for a further discussion of custody and control.

“Health information” is defined in section 1(1)(k) to mean diagnostic, treatment and care
information (section 1(1)(i)) and registration information (section 1(1)(u)).

 4.2.1  NATURE AND FORM OF REQUEST

Formal Request for Correction or Amendment
The request must be submitted in writing to the custodian whom the applicant believes has
custody or control of the health information in dispute. The applicant may use the Request to
Correct or Amend Health Information Form found in Appendix 1 of this Publication or use a
letter to request that the correction or amendment be made.

An applicant must provide proof or evidence in support of the request for correction or
amendment. The proof should be of the same nature and at least the same quality as was
required when the original information was collected. For example, a birth or baptismal
certificate might be needed to prove an individual’s age for eligibility for certain benefits.
Reports of x-ray or laboratory tests or document showing a medical diagnosis might be needed
to prove that a certain medical condition exists; or academic diplomas or certificates could
prove certain competencies or educational qualifications of a health services provider.

Note that there are no fees required to be paid by an applicant who is requesting a correction
or amendment to his or her own health information.

 4.2.2  HOW DOES A CUSTODIAN RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR CORRECTION

OR AMENDMENT OF HEALTH INFORMATION?

Within the time limits set out in section 13 or any extended period under section 15 and
section 87, a custodian must decide whether it will make or refuse to make a correction or
amendment to health information (section 13(2)).

CHAPTER FOUR – Correction or Amendment of Health Information

 4.2.3  AGREEING TO MAKE A CORRECTION OR AMENDMENT

When a custodian agrees to make a correction of an error or to amend health information, all
records containing the health information in question must be corrected. This includes records
in all forms and formats – paper, electronic and microform. When a custodian agrees to add
omitted health information, all records containing the health information in any form or format
must be updated to add the omitted information.

In addition to making the correction or amendment, the custodian must:

 • give written notice to the applicant that the correction or amendment has been made; and
 • notify any person to whom the information has been disclosed during the one-year period
before the correction or amendment was requested, that the correction or amendment has
been made (section 13(3)).

This is one of the reasons why a custodian must make a notation of the disclosure of a record
containing diagnostic, treatment and care information (section 41) (excluding disclosures
through electronic access to Information stored in a computer database where the database
automatically keeps and electronic of log of the name or number of the custodian to whom
the Information Is disclosed, the date and time of the disclosure, and a description of the
information that is disclosed (section 41(1.1)).

Making the Correction or Amendment
The requested correction or amendment is made by noting it on the record containing the
health information, close to the information under challenge. The notation should be signed
and dated. When designing electronic forms and databases, care should be given to allow for
this kind of notation process.

In cases where health information is stored on a medium such as microform, a linking
process may have to be used to update the information. To “link” a record means to attach,
join or connect the record to the requested correction or amendment. This may consist of a
letter or statement from the applicant or a copy of the Request to Correct or Amend Health
Information Form.

The custodian must ensure that the new information is stored and retrieved with the original
information whenever the information is used for an administrative purpose directly affecting
the individual involved. In addition, the notation of the correction or amendment must
be made available to the individual should he or she request access to his or her health
information (see OIPC Order 97-020).  http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/97-020.pdf

Notifying the Applicant
The custodian must give the applicant written notice of its decision. Model Letter I in
Appendix 2 of this Publication may be used to notify the applicant that the correction or
amendment has been made. A copy of the corrected or amended record should be attached or
the applicant advised of the name and address of the appropriate office where the corrected or
amended record can be inspected.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FOUR – Correction or Amendment of Health Information

Notifying Other Persons
Section 13(3)(c) requires a custodian to inform any person to whom the health information
has been disclosed, that the correction or amendment has been made. Notification must be
given to any person who has received the information within one year prior to the request
for correction or amendment. This ensures that other parties have accurate and complete
information for their own decision-making processes.

Notification of other persons is not necessary if:

 • the custodian believes that the applicant will not be harmed if the notification is not

provided; and

 • the applicant agrees (section 13(4)).

To ensure that the applicant is advised and agrees with the custodian’s assessment, the
applicant should consent in writing to dispensing with notification. Model Letter K in
Appendix 2 of this Publication may be used to advise the applicant and request the applicant’s
consent to dispensing with notification of other persons.

Routine Requests
For routine corrections or amendments, such as a change of name, address, etc., there is no
need to follow the formal request for correction process under the Act. However, the custodian
should follow its own procedure regarding the proof that the applicant needs to provide before
the correction or amendment is made.

 4.2.4

REFUSING TO MAKE A CORRECTION OR AMENDMENT

If a custodian refuses to make the requested correction or amendment, it must, notify the
applicant within the time limits in section 13 or any extended time periods under section 15 or
section 87, and provide reasons for the refusal (section 13(5)).

Notifying the Applicant
The custodian must give the applicant written notice of its decision. Model Letter I in
Appendix 2 of this Publication may be used to notify the applicant of the refusal to make the
requested correction or amendment. In the notice, the custodian must also tell the applicant
that he or she may ask the Commissioner to review the custodian’s decision or submit a
statement of disagreement.

Grounds for Refusal
A custodian may refuse or may be unable to make a requested correction or amendment
because it is not satisfied with the proof presented by the applicant.

In Orders H2004-004 and H2005-006 the Privacy Commissioner established that the applicant
has the burden of proof under section 13(1) of HIA to show where there has been an error or
omission.  (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

Health and Wellness

116

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FOUR – Correction or Amendment of Health Information

In addition to refusing because of lack of satisfactory proof, section 13(6) permits a custodian
to refuse to make a correction or amendment in respect of:

 • a professional opinion or observation made by a health services provider about the

applicant (section 13(6)(a)); or

 • a record that was not originally created by that custodian (section 13(6)(b)).

In Orders H2004-004 and H2005-006 the Commissioner established that the custodian has the
burden of proof to show that the information consists of professional opinions or observations
under section 13(6)(a). (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

Section 13(6)(a) recognizes that the significance of an opinion may be that it reflects another
person’s view at the time it was offered. It may be important to have a record of that view or
assessment at a later date. Section 14(1)(b) allows an individual to have his or her views about
that opinion added to the record for other readers to consider.

If the health information requested to be corrected or amended is in a record that was not
created by the custodian receiving the request (section 13(6)(b)) the applicant may be referred
to the custodian who did create the record if their identity can be determined from the record.

Request for Review or Submission of Statement of Disagreement
Under section 14(1), if a custodian refuses to make a correction or amendment, the custodian
must tell the applicant that he or she may elect to do either of the following but not both:

 • ask the Commissioner to review the custodian’s decision; or
 • submit a statement of disagreement.

Under section 73(1), an individual may ask the Commissioner to review a custodian’s decision
to refuse to correct or amend health information. A request for review must be in writing and
must follow the requirements in section 74.

A “statement of disagreement” (in section 14(1)(b) must:

 • be 500 words or less
 • set out the requested correction or amendment
 • set out the applicant’s reasons for disagreeing with the custodian’s decision.

In Order H2005-005 the Commissioner ruled that the custodian was not required to attach the
statement of disagreement to the applicant’s record because the statement of disagreement
did not meet the requirements set out in section 14(1)(b). (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FOUR – Correction or Amendment of Health Information

In Order H2009-001, the Adjudicator determined that an applicant’s Statement of
Disagreement contained some information that was unrelated to the corrections or
amendments of his health information that he had requested. However, this extraneous
information does not render the Statement of Disagreement non-compliant with
section 14(1) (b). The Adjudicator ordered the custodian to attach the applicant’s entire
Statement of Disagreement to his discharge summary, and to provide a copy to any person to
whom the custodian had disclosed the applicant’s discharge summary within the past year.
(http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

On receiving the statement of disagreement, the custodian must:

 • if reasonably practicable, attach the statement to the record that is the subject of the

requested correction or amendment; and

 • provide a copy of the statement of disagreement to any person to whom the custodian has
disclosed the record in the one-year period prior to the applicant’s request for correction or
amendment (section 14(3)).

This is similar to the notification requirement with which custodians must comply in
section 13(3)(c) when making a correction or amendment. Model Letter I in Appendix 2 can
be used for this purpose.

 4.2.5

TIME LIMITS FOR RESPONDING

Agreeing or Refusing to Make a Correction or Amendment
Under section 13(2), a custodian must decide to make, or refuse to make, the requested
correction or amendment within 30 days after receiving the request or within any extended
period under section 15. Alternatively, the custodian can make a request to the Commissioner
to disregard a request for a correction or amendment if it appears to be frivolous or vexatious.
See sections 2.4.9 and 2.4.10 of this Publication for information on dealing with frivolous or
vexatious requests.

Deemed Refusal
If the custodian fails to respond to a request for correction or amendment in accordance with
section 13 within 30 days or within any extended period under section 15, it is treated as a
decision to refuse to make the correction or amendment (section 13(7)). The applicant can ask
the Commissioner to review the decision to refuse under section 73(1).

Submission of Statement of Disagreement
Section 14(2) states that an applicant who elects to submit a statement of disagreement
must submit the statement to the custodian within 30 days after the written notice of refusal
has been given to the applicant under section 13(5) or within any extended period under
section 15(3).

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FOUR – Correction or Amendment of Health Information

Request for Review
Under section 74(2), a request for the Commissioner to review a custodian’s decision to
refuse to make a correction or amendment must be in writing and must be delivered to the
Commissioner within 60 days after the applicant is notified of the decision, or any longer
period allowed by the Commissioner (section 74(2)).

In the case of a deemed refusal under section 13(7), the time limit for requesting a review
would not apply.

 4.2.6

EXTENDING TIME LIMITS

Under section 15(1), the custodian may extend the time for responding to a request under
section 13(1) for an additional period of up to 30 days or, with the Commissioner’s permission,
for a longer period if:

 • the request does not give enough detail to enable the custodian to identify the record that

is to be corrected or amended;

 • a large number of records are involved in the request and responding within the period set
out in section 13(2) would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the custodian; or

 • more time is needed to consult with another custodian before deciding whether to make

the correction or amendment requested.

Notifying the Applicant
If the time is extended, the custodian must tell the applicant:

 • the reason for the extension;
 • when a response can be expected; and
 • that the applicant may make a complaint to the Commissioner about the extension under

section 85 (section 15(2))

See Chapter 10 of this Publication for a further discussion on the Commissioner’s power to
resolve complaints.

Model Letter B in Appendix 2 of this Publication deals with time extensions for access requests
and can be modified for a request for correction or amendment. This notice is required as soon
as it is apparent that the request cannot be processed within the initial 30-day time period.

Under section 15(3), the Commissioner may extend the time within which an applicant must
submit the statement of disagreement under section 14(2) if, in the Commissioner’s opinion:

 • it is unreasonable to expect the applicant to submit the statement within the 30 day period

set out in section 14(2); or

 • it is fair to extend the time for any other reason.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FOUR – Correction or Amendment of Health Information

As was the case for extending the time limit for responding to an access request, a custodian
should consider all factors relating to the possibility of the need for a time extension before
deciding to invoke one. Common factors include:

 • the amount and type of detail needed from the applicant to clarify the request;
 • the breadth and complexity of the request, the number of records requested and the

number of files or sites which must be searched to find the requested records. Extensions
cannot be claimed for consultations within the custodian (i.e., with other affiliates) after
the records have been located;

 • the number and complexity of consultations required with other custodians or levels of

government; and

 • the quantity and type of records requiring review by other custodians.

Limits on Extensions
Custodians should make every effort to plan the processing of complicated requests for
correction or amendment so that there is a need to invoke only one extension.

If a custodian believes that responding to the request will require more than a total of 60 days
(the original 30 days plus the extended 30 day period), it should ask the Commissioner for
permission to extend the time limit beyond the original 30 days. This must be done in writing
and normally within the original 30 day time limit.

A letter to the Commissioner requesting the extension should set out the specific conditions
relating to the request which will necessitate a period greater than 60 days for its processing
and establish a reasonable period (e.g., 90 days) for producing a response.

In exceptional circumstances, a custodian who has already taken a 30 day extension, may
seek a second extension from the Commissioner. This might occur when the relevant records
suddenly involve complications not originally contemplated when planning the response
process.

Where the Commissioner refuses to grant permission for an extension, the custodian has only a
maximum of 60 days to process the request.

Custodians must document the reasons for a time limit extension. This documentation will
help support the custodian’s decision to extend the time limit for 30 days; will provide a
rationale for asking the Commissioner to extend the time limit for more than 30 days; and will
help in situations where the applicant has complained to the Commissioner about the extended
time limit.

When a request for extension is made to the Commissioner, the notice should be sent to the
applicant before the Commissioner’s final decision on the extension has been made.

After investigating a complaint about a time limit extension, the Commissioner may either
confirm or reduce the extension of a time limit as provided in section 80(3)(b).

CHAPTER FOUR – Correction or Amendment of Health Information

Day of Response
The Alberta Interpretation Act provides that, if the day a response is due falls on a statutory
holiday or a day when the office of the custodian that is authorized to receive requests under
the Health Information Act is closed, then the response is due on the next business day. The
custodian is responsible for determining whether the office that is authorized to respond is
closed. If a small or single custodian’s office is closed for staff vacations, the completion of the
request will be affected and can legitimately be delayed until the first working day after the
office reopens.

 4.2.7  DEEMED REQUESTS FOR CORRECTION OR AMENDMENT UNDER THE FOIP ACT

If a written request for correction or amendment of health information is made under
section 13(1), and the record contains information that would be subject to the FOIP Act, the
request is deemed to be a request under section 36 of the FOIP Act and that Act applies to the
request as if it had been made under section 36(1) of the FOIP Act (HIA section 16(2)).

This section does not apply if the custodian that receives the request is not a “public body” as
defined in section 1(p) of the FOIP Act (HIA section 16(3)).

However, the section would apply, for example, to a regional health authority which is a
custodian under the Health Information Act and is also a public body under the FOIP Act.

The applicant must be told that the request will be processed under the FOIP Act and whether
this will affect the timelines for responding. Model Letter H.1 of Appendix 2 of this Publication
can be used to notify the applicant that the request is being deemed a FOIP request under the
FOIP Act.

Since the provisions for processing requests for correction or amendment under the FOIP Act
are very similar to those under the Health Information Act, the impact of applying the FOIP Act
to the request should be minimal from the applicant’s perspective.

Section 37.1 of the FOIP Act states that if a request is made under section 36(1) of that Act to
correct personal information that contains information to which the Health Information Act
applies, the part of the request that relates to that information is deemed to be a request under
section 13(1) of the Health Information Act and that Act applies as if the request had been
made under section 13(1) of the Health Information Act.

This section does not apply if the public body that receives the request is not a custodian as
defined in section 1(1)(f) of the Health Information Act.

CHAPTER FOUR – Correction or Amendment of Health Information

 4.3

ADMINISTERING THE CORRECTION OR AMENDMENT PROCESS

Custodians should develop procedures to process requests for correction or amendment and
to ensure that processing occurs within established time limits and in accordance with the
requirements of the Health Information Act.

 4.3.1

RECEIPT AND LOGGING OF REQUEST

Once a request is received by a custodian (either in the authorized office of the Health
Information Coordinator of a large or decentralized custodian or in the authorized office
of a single or smaller custodian), it should be registered and logged. This could be done
electronically if an automated tracking system is in use.

It should then be placed in a request for correction file and details of the request forwarded
to the office or program area of a custodian that has custody or control of the health record(s)
in dispute. The office of the Coordinator can record the assignment of responsibility on the
request tracking system.

The identity of the applicant will be needed to locate and retrieve records containing the
disputed health information but should be disclosed only:

 • to those officials and employees of the custodian who have a need to know it in order

to carry out their job duties; and

 • to the extent necessary to carry out the custodian’s function in processing the

applicant’s request.

 4.3.2

CLARIFYING THE REQUEST

If a request does not sufficiently describe the records sought to be corrected or amended, a
custodian should advise the applicant and offer to help clarify or narrow the request. Model
Letter H in Appendix 2 can be used in this situation.

If an applicant has requested a large number of corrections the Health Information Coordinator
should try to narrow the request while still meeting the applicant’s needs. This could result in
provision of better service, in terms of both time and results.

If the scope of a request for correction has been changed, the custodian should document the
change and send a notice to the applicant (see Model Letter I in Appendix 2).

 4.3.3  ACKNOWLEDGING THE REQUEST

The custodian should acknowledge receipt of a request. This acknowledgment may say that
the request:

 • has been received and processing will commence;
 • is not clear or precise enough and more information is needed to clarify it before

processing can commence; or

CHAPTER FOUR – Correction or Amendment of Health Information

 • contains information that is subject to the FOIP Act. That part of the request is deemed to
be a request for correction under the FOIP Act. The applicant should be told how that part
of the request will be dealt with.

If processing cannot start immediately, an effort should be made to contact the applicant by
telephone to resolve any problems quickly. A written follow-up to this call is good practice. It
will provide a definite reference point as to when processing commenced.

Model Letter H in Appendix 2 sets out the options for acknowledging receipt of a request for
correction or amendment.

 4.3.4

LOCATING AND RETRIEVING RECORDS

A custodian must make every reasonable effort to respond to a request for correction or
amendment of health information openly, accurately and completely. Normally, the area
responsible for the custody or control of records relevant to a request would be asked to locate
and retrieve the records.

This responsibility may rest with the medical records technician or medical records
unit of a health facility or clinic or it may rest with a staff member of a physician’s or
pharmacist’s office.

In most cases, an applicant will be asking for correction or amendment of a specific record or
specific information in a database, so the record or information should be able to be retrieved
within a reasonably short period of time. For example, the applicant’s records indicate that he
or she has no drug allergies when, in fact, he or she is allergic to penicillin.

An applicant can ask the Commissioner to review the adequacy of a search to locate records
(section 85(a)). When this happens, the custodian will have to demonstrate that it made
a reasonable search of all areas and repositories where records relevant to the request for
correction might be located.

(See OIPC Orders H2005-003 and 96-022  http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/96-022.
pdffor the criteria the Commissioner uses in judging the adequacy of a search for records).

Custodians must not dispose of any records relating to a request after it is received, even if
the records are scheduled for destruction under an approved records retention and disposition
schedule. This includes any e-mail and transitory records relevant to the request that may
exist at the time the request is received. The receipt of a request under section 13(1) freezes
all disposition activity relating to the records covered by the request until the request has been
completed, the time period for any appeal to the Commissioner has elapsed or an appeal has
been decided.

Where records have been destroyed prior to the receipt of a request, in accordance with an
approved records retention and disposition schedule, the custodian’s response to the applicant
should indicate that the records have been destroyed, quoting the authority for, and date
of destruction.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FOUR – Correction or Amendment of Health Information

When records have been transferred to the Provincial Archives of Alberta (in the case of the
Department), or to the archives of a custodian, the applicant may be referred to the archives.

 4.3.5

COPYING RETRIEVED RECORDS

Once the records have been located, either the program area in a larger custodian or the office
of the Health Information Coordinator, as appropriate, prepares them for review in terms of the
correction or amendment and completes the request documentation.

This may involve the copying and numbering of all records pertinent to the request
and preparing:

 • a list of all records areas searched; and
 • a list of the records located in each records area, along with identifying data and parts of

file lists, data dictionaries or other finding aids used in locating the records.

 4.3.6

REVIEWER’S RECOMMENDATIONS

The Health Information Coordinator or other individual responsible for reviewing the requested
record(s) recommends whether a correction or amendment should be made or refused. This
recommendation forms the basis for a discussion between a physician or pharmacist and the
staff member who reviewed the request and the record(s) or between the Coordinator and
decision-maker in a larger custodian.

At this stage, any legal advice needed to resolve issues arising from the request should be
sought. Any interpretive or policy issues which need to be raised should be identified and
consultation undertaken.

A written memo of the reviewer’s recommendations should contain:

 • a summary of file systems, offices and records storage facilities searched;
 • copies of records relevant to the request; and
 • a written summary of recommendations for making or refusing to make the correction or

amendment, including any background information to explain decisions.

The memo should be approved by whomever the custodian has designated as the responsible
person to approve requests for correction or amendment.

 4.3.7  DOCUMENTING AND TRACKING REQUESTS FOR CORRECTION

OR AMENDMENT

Custodians should maintain documentation systems to record all deliberations and decisions
regarding the processing of requests for correction or amendment and to help ensure that the
request process meets the requirements set out in the Act.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FOUR – Correction or Amendment of Health Information

The documentation may become a critical part of the evidence required during a review by
the Commissioner. It can also be of assistance in processing subsequent similar requests (see
OIPC Order 99-011). http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/99-011.pdf

The 30 day time period for responding to requests starts on the day after receipt of a request
for correction in the office of the custodian designated to receive such request. In a large
or decentralized custodian, this would normally be the office of the Health Information
Coordinator. A request may be delivered to any office of a custodian during normal business
hours, but the time limit for responding does not start until the request is received in an office
authorized to receive requests.

Custodians need to have a reasonable system in place to ensure that requests are forwarded
immediately to the office(s) designated to receive and begin processing them.

Reasonable steps might include special forwarding instructions to staff in mail rooms or to staff
who open the mail, as well as use of a color-coded transmittal file to indicate the priority and
important nature of the request. Staff should be made aware of the urgent nature of requests
under the Health Information Act and the need to forward them immediately to the Health
Information Coordinator or person designated as responsible for responding to requests.

Once the request is received in the authorized office, it should be date-stamped.

Custodians may establish an automated or manual tracking system depending upon the volume
of work generated by requests under the Act. Tracking systems help ensure that the time
periods under the Act are complied with and keep track of progress in responding to a request.
Automated systems are not normally needed unless a custodian receives more than 50 requests
annually (including access requests) or the custodian is decentralized and there is a need to
coordinate responses. Database software, such as Microsoft Access, could be used to develop
an automated tracking system for requests.

 4.3.8  MAINTAINING COPIES OF REQUESTS AND RECORDS

BEST PRACTICE: Custodians should keep a file for each request for correction or amendment
processed under the Act. This file should include:

•	 all	internal	and	external	correspondence,	including	a	copy	of	the	original	request	from	the

applicant, any notices sent to the applicant and any other correspondence from the applicant;

•	 an	unmarked	copy	of	the	record(s)	retrieved	and	reviewed	in	response	to	a	request;

•	 a	copy	of	the	corrected	or	amended	record(s)	or	a	notation	of	the	refusal	to	correct	or	amend	and

the reasons for this;

•	 a	copy	of	a	statement	of	disagreement	from	the	applicant	(if	any);	and

•	 any	other	information	documenting	the	request	management	process.

This practice helps support the custodian in any review by the Commissioner.

CHAPTER FOUR – Correction or Amendment of Health Information

 4.3.9

CLOSURE AND RETENTION OF REQUEST FILES

It is a good practice to keep a request for correction or amendment file active for at least 60
days after responding to a request in order to allow time for a request for a review by the
Commissioner. If a review is requested, the file will be reopened and remain open until the
review process is complete.

Once the file is closed, either because the custodian has responded to the request, a review has
been completed, or a request has been declared to be abandoned, the custodian must retain
the request file for the period of time authorized by its retention and disposition schedule.
Custodians must not transfer, store or destroy request records except in accordance with
such authorization.

 4.3.10  ABANDONMENT OF REQUESTS

Sometimes applicants will indicate in writing or by telephone an intention not to proceed with
a request. This may be because they have changed their mind or because they feel they no
longer need the information corrected or amended.

However, an applicant may simply cease to respond during the processing of a request. When
this situation occurs, section 9 sets out the provisions for declaring a request to be abandoned.
The custodian must have contacted the applicant in writing to seek further information
necessary to process the request.

If the applicant does not respond within 30 days of being contacted, the custodian can advise
the applicant, in writing, that the request for correction or amendment has been declared
abandoned as of a specific date. This notice must state that the applicant can ask for a review
of the decision by the Commissioner.

In some cases, an applicant abandons a request after processing is completed. For example,
an applicant may have asked to pick up the corrected/amended records and does not do so.
If the custodian:

 • has responded to the applicant’s request, stating whether the correction or amendment will

be made or refused;

 • has indicated where and when the record(s) may be picked up; and
 • the applicant does not respond or pick up the records within 30 days

the custodian can advise the applicant that the request has been declared abandoned. The file
should be kept active for a further 60 days in order to allow time for the applicant to request a
review by the Commissioner.

Model Letter D in Appendix 2 deals with this type of situation for access requests and can be
modified for requests for correction or amendment.

CHAPTER FOUR – Correction or Amendment of Health Information

THI NGS TO REMEMB ER

CORRECTION OR AMENDMENT OF HEALTH INFORMATION

Written Request

 • An individual has a right to make a written request asking that a correction or

amendment be made to their own health information.

 • A request for correction or amendment of health information must be submitted
in writing to the custodian whom the applicant believes has custody or control
of the health information in dispute. The applicant may use the Request to
Correct or Amend Health Information Form (in Appendix 1 of this Publication)
(section 13(1)).

Routine Requests

 • For routine corrections such as a change of name, address, etc., there is no need

to follow the formal request for correction process under the Act but the custodian
should follow its own procedures regarding the required proof needed to make the
correction or amendment.

Time Limits

 • A request for correction or amendment of health information must be responded to
by the custodian within 30 calendar days unless the time limit has been extended in
accordance with the Act (section 13(2) and (3), or section 87).

No Cost

 • There are no fees for processing a request for correction or amendment.

Model Letters

 • For help in processing a request, refer to the Model Letters (in Appendix 2 of this

Publication).

Agreeing to Make the Correction

 • If the custodian agrees to correct or amend health information, all records

containing the information must be corrected or updated and the custodian must
notify any person to whom the information has been disclosed during the prior one-
year period that the correction or amendment has been made (section 13(3)).

THINGS TO REMEMBER

CHAPTER FOUR – Correction or Amendment of Health Information

Refusal to Correct

 • A custodian may refuse to make a correction or amendment if there is lack of

satisfactory proof, if the record was not originally created by that custodian or if the
correction or amendment deals with a professional opinion or observation made by
a health services provider about the applicant (section 13(6)).

Review by Commissioner

 • If the custodian refuses to make the correction or amendment, the applicant must
be told that he or she may either ask the Commissioner to review the custodian’s
refusal or submit a statement of disagreement in 500 words or less (section 14).

Dealing with Repetitious or Systematic Requests
A custodian may be allowed to disregard a request or requests if they would
unreasonably interfere with the operation of the custodian or amount to an abuse of
the right to make those requests due to their repetitious or systematic nature, or if
one or more of the requests are frivolous or vexatious. The custodian must request
authorization from the Commissioner to disregard a request. The “clock is stopped” for
the deadline to respond until the Commissioner makes a ruling (section 87).

Deemed Request under the FOIP Act
If a request for correction or amendment contains information that would be subject to
the FOIP Act, the rules under the FOIP Act apply to the request (section 16(2)).

Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to
Health Information

 5.1

OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER FIVE

This Chapter will cover:

 • the duty of custodians to only collect, use and disclose the minimum amount of health

information with the highest degree of anonymity;

 • the duty of custodians to ensure the accuracy of health information; identify affiliates
that are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Act and regulations and for
establishing or adopting policies and procedures to facilitate the implementation of the
Act and regulations;

 • the duty of custodians to maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to
protect the privacy of individuals and the confidentiality of their health information;
 • the duty of custodians to do privacy impact assessments whenever new administrative

practices and information systems relating to the collection, use and disclosure of
individually identifying health information are being proposed;

 • the power of custodians to charge a fee for providing copies of an individual’s

health record;

 • the power of custodians to transform health information to create non‑identifying

health information;

 • the power of custodians to enter into agreements with “information managers”; and
 • the rules that custodians must follow for data matching.

 5.2

GENERAL DUTIES OF CUSTODIANS

The duties of custodians are set out in Part 6 of the Act and encompass a set of fair information
practices for health information. Fair information practices are universally understood by
organizations that are subject to access and privacy legislation such as the Alberta Freedom
of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, Health Information Act and Personal Information
Protection Act.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

Under the Health Information Act, the collection, use and disclosure of health information
must, in all cases, be carried out in the most limited manner and with the highest degree of
anonymity that is possible in the circumstances (section 2(c)). This fundamental purpose of
the Act applies throughout the Act to all custodians, including the Minister and the Department.

The other duties of custodians set out in Part 6 of the Act (Duties and Powers of Custodians
Relating to Health Information) relate to another fundamental purpose of the Health
Information Act as listed in section 2(a), namely the establishment of strong and effective
mechanisms to protect the privacy and confidentiality of an individual’s health information.

 5.2.1  DUTY TO COLLECT, USE AND DISCLOSE HEALTH INFORMATION WITH

THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF ANONYMITY POSSIBLE

The decision by a custodian to collect, use or disclose “individually identifying health
information” (the most sensitive level of information) should only be made after considering
whether “aggregate” or other “non‑identifying” health information would adequately achieve
the intended purpose.

Under section 57(2), custodians are expected to first consider whether the collection, use or
disclosure of “aggregate health information” would be adequate for the intended purpose. If
that is the case, the custodian must collect, use or disclose only “aggregate health information”.

If “aggregate health information” is not adequate for the intended purpose, the custodian must
then consider whether other “non‑identifying health information” would be adequate for the
intended purpose. If that is the case, the custodian may collect, use or disclose other “non‑
identifying health information” (section 57(3)).

If “aggregate” and other “non‑identifying health information” is not adequate for the
intended purpose, the custodian may collect, use or disclose “individually identifying health
information” if the collection, use or disclosure:

 • is authorized by the Act; and
 • is carried out in accordance with the Act (section 57(4)).

“Aggregate health information” means non‑identifying health information about groups of
individuals with common characteristics. This is often referred to as statistical information
and often is the kind of information from which it is virtually impossible to identify a single
individual, unless the cell or sample size is very small (less than 10).

An example of aggregate health information would be a regional health authority in a large
urban region disclosing to a researcher the number of caesarian sections performed in that
region on women over the age of 25.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

“Non-identifying health information” means that the identity of the individual who is the
subject of the information cannot be readily ascertained from the information (section 1(1) (r)).
By removing an individual’s name and personal identifiers before information is disclosed
from information or records that were identifiable, and by not providing other contextual
information, the information could essentially become anonymous individual or non‑
identifying information.

“Individually identifying health information” means that the identity of the individual who
is the subject of the information can be readily ascertained from the information (section 1(1)
(p)). This type of information would include personal identifiers such as an individual’s name,
address, birth date, full postal code, personal health number, and so on.

“Readily ascertained” in the context of section 57, means that the identity of an individual
(e.g., the individual’s name or other identifiers or distinguishing characteristics associated with
an individual) can be determined or deduced without having to apply a sophisticated technical
method or process, or without having any particular technical expertise to do so.

The identity of an individual can be said to be “readily ascertained” if:

 • the identity can be determined by combining available data or information within the same

or in several different records held by one custodian;

 • the identity can be determined by comparing information representing distinguishing

characteristics with other information sources having both the distinguishing
characteristics and the names or other identifiers of individuals; and

 • if only readily available or conventional computer hardware, software and technical

expertise is used.

Need to Know
The “need to know” principle is expressed in sections 24, 28 and 43. These sections require
affiliates of custodians to collect, use or disclose health information in a manner that is in
accordance with that affiliate’s duties to the custodian.

Section 24 states that an affiliate of a custodian must not collect health information in any
manner that is not in accordance with the affiliate’s duties to the custodian. Under section
28, an affiliate of a custodian must not use health information in any manner that is not in
accordance with the affiliate’s duties to the custodian.

Section 43 expresses a similar requirement regarding disclosure. Under that section, an affiliate
of a custodian must not disclose health information in any manner that is not in accordance
with the affiliate’s duties to the custodian.

Applying this principle to section 57, an employee with an administrative or policy role for a
custodian should not necessarily have access to individually identifying health information
since there may be no need for him or her to use health information in that form.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

When Principle of Highest Degree of Anonymity Does Not Apply

Custodians do not have to apply this “continuum” of highest degree of anonymity to the
collection, use or disclosure of health information when they are using this information for the
purpose of providing “health services” (as defined in section 1(1)(m)), or for determining or
verifying the eligibility of an individual to receive a “health service” (section 57(5)).

 5.2.2  DUTY TO COLLECT, USE AND DISCLOSE HEALTH INFORMATION

IN A LIMITED MANNER

In addition to complying with section 57, custodians must also collect, use or disclose only the
amount of health information that is essential to enable the custodian, or the recipient of the
information, to carry out the intended purpose (section 58(1)).

Not all of the health information created and maintained by a custodian is relevant or
necessary to carry out a certain purpose or address a request for information. Even if a
custodian is required by the Act to disclose health information, it should be done by disclosing
the least amount possible to achieve the intended purpose.

For example, a physician would not release a patient’s complete file without knowing who the
information is being disclosed to, why it is needed and whether the same purpose could be
achieved by releasing less information. Even if the Act requires the disclosure of individually
identifying health information, the personal health number, date of service and a code
indicating the type of service might be sufficient.

Need to Know
The “need to know” principle, expressed in sections 24, 28 and 43 (see discussion under
2.3.1), also applies to section 58(1). Affiliates of custodians may only collect, use and disclose
the least amount of health information necessary to achieve their intended purpose. Even
employees or others involved in direct patient care should only have access to information
about the patients they are responsible for or are providing care to.

Expressed Wishes of Individual
In deciding how much health information to disclose, a custodian must consider any expressed
wishes of the individual who is the subject of the information, together with any other factors
the custodian considers relevant (section 58(2)). A similar requirement applies to a custodian
making prescribed health information accessible via the Alberta EHR (section 56.31). That
means that patients can request that their information in the Alberta EHR be masked.

The power to “transform” individually identifying health information to create non‑identifying
health information in section 65 is discussed later in this Chapter under section 5.3.1.
Anonymity transformation may be used to support the requirements set out in sections 57
and 58.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

 5.2.3  DUTY TO PROTECT HEALTH INFORMATION

Custodians are the trusted “gatekeepers” of health information. Section 60 requires custodians
to protect the privacy of individuals who are the subject of health information and the
confidentiality of the health information that is in their custody or under their control. This
duty to protect covers health information that is transmitted or transported to other custodians
or to others outside the “controlled arena”, including persons outside Alberta.

All of the rules regarding protection of health information in section 60 of the Act and in
section 8 of the Health Information Regulation apply to health information in any form,
format or information system. The rules apply whether the information system is paper‑based,
electronic or a combined system.

“Privacy” is the “general right of the individual to be left alone, to be free from interference,
from surveillance and from intrusions.”1 In the context of health information protection, it
is the right of an individual to be able to control access to as well as the collection, use and
disclosure of his or her information.

“Confidentiality” implies a trust relationship between the person supplying information and
the individual or organization collecting it. The relationship is built on the assurance that
the information will only be used by or disclosed to authorized persons or to others with
the individual’s permission. Protecting the confidentiality of health information implies that
individually identifying health information is concealed from all but authorized parties.

What Must Custodians Do to Protect Health Information?

 • Under section 60(1)(a), custodians must take reasonable steps, in accordance with the
requirements in the regulations (section 8 of the Health Information Regulation), to
maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the protection of
health information in their custody or under their control.
“Taking reasonable steps” means complying with the general and specific obligations and
standards for health information security set out in section 8 of the Health Information
Regulation.
“Administrative, technical and physical safeguards” generally include administrative
procedures, physical standards and technical security services and mechanisms.

 • Under section 60(1)(b), custodians must protect the privacy of individuals who are the
subject of health information and the confidentiality of health information that is to be
stored or used in a jurisdiction outside Alberta or that is to be disclosed by the custodian to
a person in a jurisdiction outside Alberta.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

 • Under section 60(1)(c), custodians must protect the health information in their custody or

under their control against any reasonably anticipated:
–  threat or hazard to the security or integrity of the health information or of loss of the

health information, or

–  unauthorized use, disclosure or modification of the health information or unauthorized

access to the health information.

“Threat” means a sign or cause of possible harm.

“Hazard” means a risk, peril or danger.

“Security” means a condition of safety or freedom from fear or danger. In the context of
health information, it refers to the physical, technological or administrative arrangements
that persons or organizations use to prevent individually identifying health information
from being altered, lost or disclosed without authority.

“Integrity” refers to the condition of information being whole or complete; not modified,
deleted or corrupted.

“Unauthorized access” occurs when affiliates have access to health information that they
do not need to see or handle in the course of their duties. It also refers to situations where
members of the public gain access to an individual’s health information through accidental
disclosure or surreptitious means. (See OIPC Investigation Report H2004-IR-001)

For example, a couple received numerous faxes in error from a variety of separate sources. It
was found that the only difference between the phone numbers was in the prefix where two
digits are reversed. An employee of a health service provider entered the incorrect number into
the fax machine which resulted in the patient’s health information going to the wrong party.
This error is considered to be an unauthorized disclosure of health information under the HIA.
Custodians must make a reasonable effort to ensure disclosures are made to the intended and
authorized person. Custodians also have the duty to establish or adopt policies and procedures
to facilitate the implementation of the HIA and regulations. To refer to the “Guidelines on
Facsimile Transmission” document see OIPC Investigation Report H2004-IR-001.
(http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/H2004-IR-001.pdf)

See OIPC IR H2009-IR-004 for additional guidance regarding faxing health information. In that
report, the OPIC determined that a legitimate need for immediate access to health information
was present in the circumstances, but that a more secure and equally timely mechanism for
transmission of that information existed. The availability of a system like the Alberta EHR must
be factored into a custodian’s consideration of risk when disclosing health information. If it is
essential that health information be sent immediately to support patient care and two or more
mechanisms of transmitting the information are available, a custodian should send health
information through the more secure channel unless transmission through the more secure
channel would compromise patient safety or there are other mitigating factors.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

“Unauthorized collection” occurs when individually identifying health information is
collected, acquired, received or obtained by any means for purposes that are not allowed
under section 20. That section authorizes collection if it is expressly authorized by an act
or regulation of Alberta or Canada or if the information relates directly to and is necessary
for the custodian to carry out a purpose authorized under section 27.
(See Chapter 6 of this Publication)

“Unauthorized use” refers to the use of health information for a purpose that is not
authorized under section 27.
(See Chapter 7 of this Publication)

“Unauthorized disclosure” refers to the act of revealing, showing, providing copies, selling,
giving, or relaying the content of health information in ways that are not permitted under
sections 35 to 40, 46, 47 or 53.

Health information may be at risk of unauthorized disclosure if the disposition of records
containing health information is not monitored or controlled properly.
(See section 60(2) below and Chapter 8 of this Publication)

“Unauthorized modification” may occur unintentionally or intentionally, through malicious
code, forgery or the wrongful addition of information to a record containing health
information.

 • Under section 60(1)(d), custodians must ensure that their employees, affiliates and

information managers, (contracted to store health information or provide information
management and technology services), comply with this section and with the Act.

 • Under section 60(2), custodians must maintain appropriate safeguards to address risks
associated with electronic health records and the proper disposal of records to prevent
any reasonably anticipated unauthorized use or disclosure of the health information or
unauthorized access to the health information following its disposal.

(See section 11.2.4 – Scheduling and Disposition of Recorded Health Information in
Chapter 11 of this Publication)

Examples of improper disposal of health information that could result in unauthorized access,
use or disclosure of the information are: the shredding of health information with no authority
to do so, the discarding of records containing health information in a garbage container or
recycle bin, or the sale of a computer without ensuring that health information is completely
and permanently removed from the hard drive. (See OIPC Investigation Reports H2001-IR-009
and H2003-IR-002 or H0252). (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

 • Destruction of health information to prevent access by the individuals who are the subject

of the information is also an unauthorized disposal of the information.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

What are the Reasonable Steps for Protection of Health Information that are
Required by the Health Information Regulation?
Under section 8(1) of the Regulation, custodians must identify and maintain a written record of
all administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in respect of health information.

This step usually begins with the establishment of an organization‑wide written policy
and procedures on health information security and includes an inventory of the safeguards
respecting health information that will be maintained by the custodian and its affiliates.

(See section 11.3.4 in Chapter 11 of this Publication for information on Developing a
Security Policy)

Under section 8(2) of the Regulation, custodians must designate an affiliate with overall
responsibility for the security and protection of health information in their custody or under
their control.

This step has more relevance for larger custodians where an affiliate would be designated as
having responsibility for developing, implementing, maintaining, coordinating and monitoring
an information security program consistent with the requirements of the Health Information
Act and the Regulation as well as any information security policies and procedures of the
custodian. However, for single site or smaller custodians, either the custodian him/herself or an
affiliate would have to take on or be given this responsibility.

Under section 8(3) of the Regulation, custodians must periodically assess their administrative,
technical and physical safeguards in respect of:

 • the confidentiality of health information in its custody or under its control and the privacy

of the individuals who are the subjects of that information;

 • any reasonably anticipated threat or hazard to the security or integrity of the health

information or to the loss of the health information; and

 • any unauthorized use, disclosure or modification of the health information or unauthorized

access to the health information.

To carry out this step:

 • Custodians should use a threat and risk assessment to determine the level of sensitivity of

health information and the potential threats and risks to its security.

“Threat and Risk Assessment” refers to the process of determining what harm or whom
to protect against and then assessing whether existing or proposed security measures are
satisfactory and determining vulnerabilities.

(See section 11.3.3 in Chapter 11 of this Publication for information on conducting a
Threat and Risk Assessment)

 • Once a Threat and Risk Assessment has been completed, custodians should take steps

over time, and within available resources, to develop or adopt, implement or maintain the
administrative, technical and physical safeguards necessary to protect health information in
their custody or under their control.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

 • Custodians should then periodically review the level of information security, the risks to

security and the administrative, technical and physical safeguards they have put in place to
protect the health information in their custody or under their control.

OIPC Investigation Report H2005-IR-001 (Missing Computer Tape Containing Health
Information) dealt with a situation where an IT company, contracted to provide services for
a custodian, lost a data tape containing health information. The IT company advised the
custodian that the tape appeared to be missing eleven days after becoming aware of the loss.
The investigator concluded that the actual risk to individuals in this case was low, however,
recommended that the custodian post a notice on its website for 30 days. The investigator
also recommended that the contract be updated and clarified regarding the timelines for
notification in cases of possible privacy breaches. (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

Depending upon the type and level of threats and risks to health information in the custody
or under the control of a custodian, the following administrative, physical and technical
safeguards may be used:

Administrative Safeguards

 • Access to health information and access to any place or system where health information
is kept must be restricted to individuals who are authorized to use, modify, transform,
disclose or dispose of health information to perform their assigned duties. Employees and
other information users must be authorized to access, maintain, change, use or distribute
information. Authorization for each information user should be based on the ‘need to
know’ of that individual.

 • Security checks may need to be employed to ensure that individuals in key employee

positions are screened. This includes background checks and taking oaths of
confidentiality, where necessary.

 • All systems programmers, network/LAN technical staff, ID administrators, file and

mailroom staff have privileged access to the work environment and have to be “trusted”.
Screening of personnel should be done on a regular basis, and criminal record checks may
be appropriate and required in some cases.
For example, under the Protection of Persons in Care Act, “agencies” like hospitals and
nursing homes must require every successful applicant for employment and every new
volunteer to provide a criminal records check.

 • Information access privileges should be reviewed, modified or revoked as necessary when:

–  an employee is transferred by appointment, assignment or secondment;
–  an employee commences an extended period of absence, including maternity, medical,

military or community service;

–  access privileges have not been exercised for a period of time; or

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

–  the employment or contract of the individual has been terminated. Upon termination:

•  the individual should be debriefed with respect to ongoing responsibilities for the

confidentiality of custodian information;

•  access privileges (system passwords, user ID’s, combinations, etc.) to systems,

restricted access zones, and IT facilities should be revoked; and

•  all security related items (badges, keys, documents, etc.) issued to the individual

should be retrieved.

 • To ensure that parties accessing information are who they say they are, the identity
of any individual who accesses, uses, modifies, transforms, discloses or disposes of
health information must be verified and authenticated prior to access to information
being granted.
The most common form of this safeguard in an electronic environment is the use of
passwords. However, it could also include requiring proof of identification using tokens,
biometrics, challenge/response scenarios, one‑time passwords, digital signatures and
certification authorities.
Authentication passwords or codes must be:
–  generated, controlled and distributed in a manner which maintains the confidentiality

and integrity of the code or password;
–  known only to the user of the identifier;
–  either pseudo‑random in nature or verified by an automated process designed to

counter triviality and repetition;

–  at least 6 characters in length;
–  one‑way encrypted for storage in the computer system subject to a history check to

preclude reuse;

–  prompted for manual user entry when using automatic or scripted log‑on processes;
–  changed at least every 90 days; and
–  a mixture of characters, both upper and lower case, numbers, punctuation and

special symbols.

 • Records should be kept identifying all instances of access, use, modification,

transformation, disclosure or disposal of individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and
care information.

 • Records must be kept of all instances of unauthorized access, use, change, deletion/

disposition or disclosure of health information.

 • Procedures, policies, practices and other safeguards must be implemented to minimize

the risk from unauthorized access to, or unauthorized use, modification, transformation,
disclosure or disposal of health information.

 • Procedures, policies and practices and other safeguards must also be implemented to

ensure accuracy and completeness of health information.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

The policies and procedures should be in writing, current, and available to all staff.
Policies, procedures and penalties should also be outlined in contracts for service
providers.

(Also refer to section 5.2.4 of this Chapter for more discussion on the duty to ensure
accuracy of health information)

Physical Safeguards

 • In addition to restrictions on who can access health information, access to the facility,
office, information retrieval equipment and systems and information stores must be
controlled to ensure that access is granted only to individuals with authorization for
such access.
These controls relate to mechanisms in a computer operating system, hardware unit,
software package, file room or mailroom. This is typically a password for systems access
but may include card locks, and physical security access systems such as keys, digital card
keys and cipher lock barriers.

 • Physical security safeguards to maintain access control can range from anti‑theft systems

such as bolting equipment to the floor in secure rooms, locked desks and cabinets.
 • Smaller custodians with little health information in electronic form should concentrate
on physical security measures (locked rooms or cabinets, adequate access controls for
employees and the public and sound disposition measures for the information). Larger
custodians with sensitive health information in a variety of forms and formats will have to
take a wider range of security measures based upon the threat and risk analysis conducted.

 • Stringent protection measures should be applied to health information with a high level
of sensitivity and with a greater possibility of causing damage to an individual if it is
accidentally disclosed, stolen or finds its way into unauthorized hands.

 • For less sensitive health information where the risk of compromise or unauthorized access

is low, a custodian may only need to put in place lower grade security measures.

Examples of these would be unlocked cabinets in a controlled area that are locked at night;
computers being kept behind service counters, with screens not visible to patients/clients other
than the subjects of the information; and computers accessed through restricted authorization
codes.

The OIPC Investigation Report H2003-IR-003 (Theft of Computers) investigates the theft of
computers that were connected to the electronic medical record system within a clinic. The
data server that stores all the health information was in a locked room and was not removed. It
was the practice of the clinic that no health information was saved on individual computer hard
drives. Thus there was no privacy breach just a significant loss of computer hardware. The clinic
had taken steps to increase the level of physical security by installing a monitored alarm system
and strengthened the rear exit door. (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

Technical Safeguards

 • See also Administrative Safeguards and Physical Safeguards for related information
about access controls and authentication passwords and codes and other forms of
user verification.

 • All methods of communication of health information must be secure from unauthorized

access, including eavesdropping, interception and diversion.

“All methods of communication” includes verbal communication, transmission of written
documentation, telephone, cellular phone, fax, e‑mail, video and audio communication or
any other form of electronic communication.

“Eavesdropping” occurs when unauthorized individuals inadvertently or through the use
of deceptive techniques such as remote monitoring of conventional telephone or cellular
phone conversations or voice mail, gain access to health information.

“Interception” occurs when unauthorized individuals inadvertently or through the use of
deceptive techniques gain access to health information e.g., by interrupting the flow of
information over a transmission line, through the use of electronic or other means.

“Diversion” occurs when the direction of the flow of health information is changed
inadvertently or through the use of deceptive techniques so that an unauthorized recipient
can gain access to it.

 • Identification and authentication safeguards or the use of audit safeguards to monitor

security systems and procedures may be needed. These include virus scanners,
firewalls, monitoring operating system logs, software logs, version control and document
disposition certification.

 • Encrypted storage and transmission is necessary for particularly sensitive health

information.

In OIPC Investigation Report H2007-IR-002 Alberta’s Privacy Commissioner
determined that password protection is not sufficient to protect personal information
and that all portable media must have a second layer of protection - namely encryption.
(See news release on the OIPC Website at
http://www.oipc.ab.ca/Content_Files/Files/News/NR_CapitalEncrypt3.pdf).

“Encryption” refers to the technique or process of transforming information from human
readable form to a meaningless form using mathematical number theory (a computational
algorithm). Encryption may be used for an entire record of information, in which case it
must be decrypted before it can be used at all.

Many computer systems keep identifiable information stored in encrypted form to prevent
casual access to information. Secure applications would decrypt the information prior to
providing access to authorized individuals performing specific activities.

Encryption can be used to transform a personal identifier to a unique, but anonymous
identifier. Anonymous identifiers allow processing of discrete person level records
to analyze information across time, data sources or geographical areas for such
purposes as measuring utilization, health system performance, and health outcomes or
program evaluation.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

Encryption may be hardware or software based and is usually “key” based. A Public Key
encryption system uses a publicly accessible and widely understood encoding/decoding
process, a set of publicly available keys, and a secret matching set of private keys.

A “key” refers to a string of digits and/or characters used to encrypt or decrypt a message.
The level of security often depends upon the length of the key.

 • All systems hardware and software must be secure from inappropriate access, accident,

misappropriation, viruses and systems failure.

 • Put in place disaster recovery safeguards. These can range from the use of on‑site

diskettes/tapes to replication with an external system and duplication (e.g., photocopiers)
on other media forms with possible off‑site storage facilities.

 • Other related safeguards include the use of redundant or fault tolerant equipment such
as disk shadowing/mirroring, dual systems, hot backups and alternate routing. These
safeguards are typically hardware based but require software/procedures to manage
the environment.

 • Procedures, policies and practices must be implemented to restore, replace or re‑create
health information that has been damaged, lost or destroyed either accidentally or
deliberately.

Under section 8(4) of the Regulation, in order to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of
health information that is to be stored or used by a person in a jurisdiction outside Alberta, or
that is to be disclosed to a person in a jurisdiction outside Alberta, custodians must enter into a
written agreement with the person prior to the storage, use or disclosure of the information.

The agreement must:

 • provide for the custodian to retain control over the health information;
 • adequately address the risks associated with the storage, use or disclosure of the health

information outside Alberta;

 • require the other party or parties to develop, adopt or implement and maintain the security

safeguards outlined in the agreement;

 • allow the custodian to monitor compliance with the terms and conditions of the

agreement; and

 • contain remedies to address any non‑compliance with or breach of the terms and

conditions of the agreement by the other party or parties.

An agreement under this section of the Regulation would be required, for example, if
individually identifying health information is going to be stored in a database in another
province or if the information is being processed by or disclosed to another organization or
company outside Alberta.

142

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

The requirement for an agreement ensures that the rules for the protection of health
information inside Alberta are also applied to health information flowing to another
jurisdiction, which may not have the same level (or any) data protection laws.

(See OIPC Report “Public Sector Outsourcing and Risks to Privacy”
http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/Outsource_Feb_2006_corr.pdf )

However, under section 8(5) of the Regulation, if individually identifying health information
is being disclosed to a person in a jurisdiction outside Alberta solely for the purpose of
providing continuing treatment and care to the individual, an agreement with the recipient is
not required.

This situation could arise where an individual travels to another province and needs to have
a prescription filled. The pharmacist in the other province may need a custodian (e.g., a
pharmacist or physician) in Alberta to disclose the individual’s drug information in order to fill
the prescription.

Section 8(4) does not apply to the following health information about an individual when it
is disclosed by the Department to a bank, credit union, credit union central, loan corporation,
trust corporation or the Alberta Treasury Branches for the purpose of facilitating bill payments
or the collection of premiums:
(a)  name, in any form;
(b)  signature;
(c)  home, business and mailing addresses, electronic address and telecommunications

numbers;

(d)  personal health number or any other unique identification number that is used to

identify the individual as eligible for, or a receipt of, a health service;

(e)  billing information, including the following:

information about amounts owed by the individual to the custodian;

(i)
(ii)  method of payment;
(iii)  the individual’s account number;
(iv)  if another person is liable for or will be billed for the amount owed by the

individual, that person’s name and account number.

Under section 8(6) of the Regulation, a custodian must ensure that all of its affiliates are aware
of and adhere to all of the custodian’s administrative, technical and physical safeguards in
respect of health information.

Without training and awareness of the custodian’s policies and procedures, no amount of
technology can secure an environment. In order to conduct an ongoing security awareness
training program, the custodian should:

 • identify the scope, goals and objectives of the program;
 • identify the trainers;
 • identify the target audiences;

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

 • motivate management and employees;
 • maintain the program; and
 • evaluate its effectiveness.

Another way of ensuring awareness of safeguards is to provide new affiliates with copies of
the custodian’s information security policies and procedures; ensure that all other affiliates
have continuing access to the policies and procedures through an internal website or intranet
on a local area or wide area network; and attach the policies and procedures as a schedule to
any contracts which require the collection, use, disclosure or protection of health information.
(See OIPC Investigation Report H2002-IR-001 (H0054 & H0056) http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

BEST PRACTICE: Personal or health information should not be stored on mobile computing devices
unless absolutely necessary. Consideration should be given to other technologies that allow secure,
remote access to the required network and data instead. If necessary, there should be a privacy
impact assessment (PIA) or security risk assessment completed prior to implementing mobile
computing. If personal or health information is required to be stored on a mobile device, keep only a
minimum amount based on the business need and use encryption to protect the data as password
protection alone is not sufficient. It is important to periodically check practices against policies to
ensure they reflect reality and remain effective. As well, specific training on mobile computing must
be provided to staff to ensure they understand the risks and how to protect their equipment.
(See OIPC Investigation Report H2006-IR-002, http://www.oipc.gov.ab.ca)

Under section 8(7) of the Regulation, custodians must establish sanctions that may be imposed
against affiliates who breach, or attempt to breach, the custodian’s administrative, technical
and physical safeguards in respect of health information.

Sanctions can include withdrawing access privileges and disciplinary action up to and
including suspension or dismissal. The sanctions for breaches of the Act, the Regulation or the
custodian’s policies and practices should also be part of the terms and conditions of contracts
relating to the access to or collection, use, disclosure, storage or disposal of health information.
Sanctions in the case of contractors could include termination of the contract.

Under section 107(4), if the contract is with an Information Manager under section 66, it
would be an offence under the Act to knowingly breach any terms and conditions of the
contract respecting the protection of health information.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

 5.2.4  DUTY TO ENSURE ACCURACY OF HEALTH INFORMATION

Before using or disclosing health information that is in its custody or under its control, a
custodian must make a reasonable effort to ensure that the information is accurate and
complete (section 61).

Part of this duty is ensuring that the source of information can be clarified and all access,
disclosure and changes can be tracked and audited.

“Making a reasonable effort” means that the custodian will be thorough and comprehensive in
identifying practicable means to ensure that health information is accurate and complete. As
well as being a privacy requirement, verification procedures and practices to ensure accuracy
and completeness are particularly good business practices for large health information systems
that deliver programs.

Custodians trying to ensure accuracy and completeness may find it helpful to answer the
following questions:

 • Is there a system of verification for health information collected and for its entry on

the system?

 • Does the record indicate the last update date?
 • Is a record kept of the source of the information used to make changes (e.g., paper or

transaction records)?

 • Is there a process in place to grant staff authorization to add, change or delete personal

information from records held by the system?

 • Is there a procedure for correcting or amending the information in the record?
 • Does the system have the necessary audit trails to determine who may have previously

relied on the incorrect information?

 • Are procedures in place for disposition of personal information and are actual records
retention and disposition schedules agreed upon and signed, for all the information in
the system?

BEST PRACTICE: There should be careful verification of any health information crucial to an
application, transaction or action when the information is provided. There could also be systematic
processes in place for updating health information, either as a result of information provided from
the individual or cross-referencing other related files providing basic identifying data.

Other checks of accuracy might be periodic audits of files with accuracy and completeness as one
of the criteria tested or establishing with the software of automated systems cross-referencing and
verification checks that identify anomalies in data.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

 5.2.5  DUTY TO IDENTIFY RESPONSIBLE AFFILIATES

Custodians remain ultimately responsible for compliance with the Health Information Act.
However, under section 62, each custodian must identify its affiliates who are responsible for
ensuring compliance with the Act, the regulations and the policies and procedures established
or adopted under section 63. To carry out this duty, custodians must first know who their
affiliates are (see ‘Who is an Affiliate’ in THINGS TO REMEMBER at the end of Chapter
1 of this Publication). They must then identify one or more of their affiliates who will be
responsible for administering and ensuring compliance with the Health Information Act, the
regulations under the Act and the custodian’s policies and procedures regarding the collection,
use, disclosure and protection of health information.

An “affiliate” is defined in section 1(1)(a) to include an employee of a custodian; a person who
performs a service for a custodian as an appointee, volunteer, student or contractor; a health
services provider who has the right to admit and treat patients at a hospital; an information
manager as defined in section 66(1); and a person who is designated under the regulations to
be an affiliate.

Under the regulation, a custodian may apply to the Minister to be designated as an affiliate
of another custodian. The custodian must first obtain the written consent from the other
custodian. The Minister must be satisfied that the applicant custodian has sufficiently
addressed a number of considerations identified in the regulation.

See section 9.3 of Chapter 9 of this Publication for more discussion regarding this duty.

 5.2.6  DUTY TO ESTABLISH OR ADOPT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

Under section 63(1), custodians must establish or adopt policies and procedures that will
facilitate the implementation of the Act and the regulations. At the request of the Minister or
the Department, a custodian must provide the Minister or Department with a copy of such
policies and procedures (section 63(2)).

(See section 9.6 of Chapter 9 of this Publication for more discussion regarding this duty.)

 5.2.7  DUTY TO PREPARE PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

Section 64(1) requires custodians to prepare a privacy impact assessment when the privacy
of individuals may be impacted by a proposed or changed administrative practice, or a new
or modified information system that collects, uses and/or discloses individually identifying
health information.

The privacy impact assessment must be submitted to the Commissioner for review and
comment before a custodian implements any proposed new practice or system or any proposed
change to existing practices and systems relating to the collection, use or disclosure of
individually identifying health information (section 64(2)).

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

What is a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)?
A “privacy impact assessment” (PIA) is a process that assists custodians in reviewing the
impact that a new project may have on individual privacy. The process is designed to ensure
that the custodian evaluates the program or scheme to ensure technical compliance with the
Health Information Act as well as assessing the broader privacy implications for individuals.

The PIA process requires a thorough analysis of potential impacts on privacy and a
consideration of measures to mitigate or eliminate any such impacts. The PIA is a due diligence
exercise, in which the custodian identifies and addresses potential privacy risks that may occur
in the course of its operations. While PIAs are focused on specific projects, the process should
also include an examination of organization‑wide practices that could have an impact on
privacy. Organizational privacy and security policies and procedures, or the lack of them, can
be significant factors in the ability of the custodian to ensure that privacy protecting measures
are available for specific projects.

A PIA provides documented assurance to the custodian, to the Commissioner and to the public
that all privacy issues related to the initiative have been appropriately identified and addressed.

When is a Privacy Impact Assessment Needed?
Custodians undertaking the following types of initiatives will likely need to conduct a PIA
under section 64(1) when:

 • A proposed system or a proposed administrative practice will relate to the collection,

storage, use, disclosure, linkage and/or matching of health information that is, or could be
made to be, individually identifying;

 • New data elements will be collected and added to an existing health information database

or a new database is proposed;

 • System access will be rolled out beyond current parameters, controls, levels or numbers

of users;

 • Health information use will be expanded to include data linkage or matching or other

purposes and uses;

 • Limited disclosure or reporting about selected individuals will be expanded to enable broad

disclosure of information about a larger population base (or even the entire population
of Alberta);

 • The way in which the system is accessed, managed or secured from a technical or

managerial perspective is changed significantly (including use of internet technology or
outsourcing); and/or

 • Retention periods for the health information in the system will be significantly changed.

In addition to the above, there are requirements for a PIA under sections 70(2), 71(2), 72
and 46(5). These requirements are dealt with later in this section of the Chapter.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

When is a Privacy Impact Assessment Not Needed?
A PIA may not be needed when the proposed system or administrative practice relates to
the collection, storage, use or disclosure exclusively of non‑identifying or aggregate health
information.

As information systems become more complex, the probability of having an unexpected
privacy impact increases. Initiatives that appear to involve minor technical enhancements for
client convenience and custodian efficiency may significantly impact individual privacy

Keeping this in mind, the following are examples of initiatives that may not require a PIA;
however it is common practice for custodians to notify the Office of the Information Privacy
Commissioner of these changes via a PIA Addendum:

 • minor changes to the scope of program information requirements, such as the collection
of additional eligibility data as authorized by statute and reflected in revised notices
or consents;

 • data matching agreements where a privacy impact assessment on the data matching has

already been developed;

 • routine system maintenance such as minor software upgrades or patches, replacement of
equipment that does not materially change information management functions or system
security; or

 • minor upgrades to systems which have no impact on the way in which health information

is managed.

What is the Process for a Privacy Impact Assessment?
1.  Management of the Process

The following are relevant considerations in managing the PIA process:

 • composition of the PIA development team. Determine which affiliates can best provide
the information needed. These would potentially be the Health Information Coordinator
or whichever affiliate(s) has (have) been designated with this responsibility; project
or program sponsors; records managers; project managers and IT/IM specialists; legal
services; communications; and senior/executive management;

 • identifying someone to lead the process and write the PIA. Ideally this requires someone

who understands the Health Information Act and privacy principles and issues; has
technical writing skills; has project management experience; and can reflect input from a
variety of sources.

2.  Timing of the Process

If the PIA is viewed as an obstacle to the initiative being launched, it has been started too late.
If decisions about the initiative are not firm, resources have not been committed and questions
about privacy implications cannot be answered, it is too early to start the process.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

It is the view of the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner that a PIA is
rarely ever finished. It is a living document that should be updated from time to time as
changes are contemplated for the program. It is expected that an organization will advise
the Commissioner’s Office of any changes or modifications to the program and provide
documentation so that the assessment on file is always up to date.

3.

Internal Approval of the PIA

The internal approval of a PIA should be based on the custodian’s established internal approval
process and should include approval from the members of the PIA development team.

4.  Public Consultation

As part of the process, it may be appropriate to consult with stakeholders or with a larger
public audience on major initiatives, or on significant overhauls of existing programs.
Consultation might involve only certain affected stakeholders or broader segments of the
public. Focused public discussion conducted early in the process can help program or system
designers anticipate public reaction to proposals or help to eliminate options that meet with
significant resistance.

The custodian should address how it intends to educate and consult with affected stakeholders
respecting the proposed initiative. Alternatively, the justification for not undertaking public
consultation should be set out.

5.  The Role of the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner

The PIA must be submitted to the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner
for review and comment before implementing the proposed new practice or system or any
proposed change to existing practices and systems (section 64(2)).

Because the onus always remains on the custodian to ensure adequate levels of privacy
protection, the Commissioner will not “approve” a PIA submitted to his office. Once satisfied
that the organization has addressed the relevant considerations and is committed to the
provision of the necessary level of privacy protection, the Commissioner will “accept” the
PIA. The PIA cannot be used to obtain a waiver of, or relaxation from, any requirement of the
Health Information Act.

To give the Commissioner enough time to formally review and comment on a PIA, custodians
should provide the PIA to the Commissioner’s office at least 45 working days before
implementing the proposed new or changed practice or system.

In practice, however, the Commissioner’s role starts long before the formal review. The process
for interaction with the Commissioner’s Office (OIPC) regarding a PIA is as follows:

 • The custodian advises the OIPC in writing about the project.
 • If the custodian’s PIA development team is uncertain if a PIA is required, or if the project

is complex, the PIA development team may meet with the OIPC staff to review the project.
The Commissioner will provide guidance that will assist the custodian in making a
decision if a PIA is required.

 • If no PIA is required, the process is concluded.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

 • If a PIA is required, the OIPC requests a PIA. If a PIA is required, it must be submitted to
the Commissioner by the chief executive officer of the custodian (or equivalent) or by the
custodian where that is a single practitioner.

 • The PIA development team prepares the PIA by completing a PIA questionnaire, with

the necessary elaboration and enclosures and submits it (from the appropriate officer) to
the Commissioner.

 • Questionnaire responses are reviewed by the OPIC within 30 working days and discussed
with the PIA development team as required. Further information may be requested, in
which cases the review period may exceed 30 working days.

 • Upon final acceptance by the OIPC, the custodian receives a letter of acceptance from the

Commissioner. This letter also advises of any future activity from the OIPC.

 • The PIA is filed by the Office of the Information Privacy Commissioner and is available for
public review upon request at the OIPC Library. A summary of the PIA is placed on the
OIPC website. (Public access to some confidential information, such as details of sensitive
security measures, is sometimes restricted. Any such restrictions are limited and specific).

 • The custodian provides updates to the PIA as changes to the project are implemented

over time.

It is the view of the OIPC that a PIA is rarely ever finished. It is a living document that should
be updated from time to time as changes are contemplated for the program. It is expected that
a custodian will advise the OIPC of any changes or modifications to the program and provide
documentation so that the assessment on file is always up to date. In addition, the custodian is
expected to monitor compliance with the terms that have been stated in the PIA.

The OIPC may utilize the PIA as a starting point for any investigation into a breach of privacy.

The Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner publishes a document on the Privacy
Impact Assessment Process called “Privacy Impact Assessment: Instructions and Annotated
Questionnaire”. This package is available for downloading from the Commissioner’s web site
at http://www.oipc.ab.ca. Alternatively, custodians may e-mail a request for a PIA package to
ipcab@oipc.ab.ca or telephone 780-422-6860.

Privacy Impact Assessment Questionnaire
The PIA Questionnaire will be considered a public document by the OIPC. Any enclosures will
also be considered public documents, unless they are explicitly designated as “confidential.”
Enclosures could include such documents as an organizational strategic or business plan
addressing privacy protection or physical or information technology security plans and access
control documentation. Enclosures that are designated as confidential must be accompanied by
the reasons for confidentiality.

The PIA Questionnaire must be submitted to the Commissioner with a covering letter from the
chief executive officer of the custodian (institutional) or from a regulated health professional
who is the custodian. Otherwise, it will not receive a formal response.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

How is the Questionnaire Completed?
The questionnaire is divided into the following two parts:
 • Part A: Organizational Privacy Management; and
 • Part B: Project Privacy Management

Each part contains a series of questions. The checkboxes on the questionnaire provide
for summary responses to the questions and the note fields provide for elaboration of the
responses, as necessary. There is also a column that can be used to cross‑reference separate
enclosures. The questionnaire can be completed either in paper or electronic formats.

Part A: Organizational Privacy Management
This part of the questionnaire is intended to provide background on organization or custodian‑
wide facets of privacy management that may affect the management of privacy issues for
the specific project. If this information has been provided with a previous PIA and has not
changed, it does not have to be resubmitted. A custodian should regularly review its’ Part A
and should notify the OIPC that this review has been completed.

The questions for each section of Part A are:

1.  Privacy Policies and Controls

 • Does the custodian have an organizational strategic plan or business plan that addresses

privacy protection? If so, enclose the information.

 • Does a written privacy charter or policy (plan, or mission statement) exist? If so, enclose

the information.

 • Have privacy guidelines, including policies, been developed for various aspects of the

custodian’s operations? If so, enclose the information.

 • Is the custodian subject to statutory provisions regarding privacy and confidentiality, other
than those provided by the Health Information Act (and the FOIP Act for custodians that
are also public bodies under the FOIP Act)? Is the legislation expressly paramount over the
Health Information Act? Enclose the relevant statutory provisions.

 • Does the custodian have policies or procedures in place to ensure that:

–  there is an essential business purpose for all health information that is collected;
–  there is statutory authority to collect health information (either under the Health

Information Act or another statute or regulation);
–  individual consent is obtained when that is required;
–  individuals are duly informed of the purpose and authority for collection of health

information;

–  individuals have a right to request access to their own health information;
–  individuals have a right to request correction or amendment of their health information

and annotation procedures are available when required; and

–  records are appropriately stored and managed to protect the privacy of individuals and

the confidentiality of their health information?

If so, provide the policies and procedures.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

 • Are privacy controls in place within the custodian that include:

–  need‑to‑know policies and procedures for access to and use of health information;
–  physical security and access controls;
–  IT security and access controls;
–  waste management (disposal) controls for health information;
–  records management policies and retention and disposition schedules;
–  enclose the relevant policies and procedures.

 • Does the custodian have an information security plan or policy? If so, enclose it.

(See section 11.3.4 of Chapter 11 of this Publication for information on Developing a
Security Policy)

2.  Privacy Structure and Organization

 • Has an affiliate been designated with responsibility for the security and protection of
health information in the custody or under the control of the custodian? If so, identify
the position.

 • Does a reporting process exist to ensure that the managers of the custodian are informed of

any privacy compliance issues?

 • Is senior management of the custodian (if any) actively involved in the development,

implementation and/or promotion of privacy measures within the custodian?

 • Are affiliates provided with training related to the protection of health information?

Part B: Project Privacy Management
In this part of the questionnaire, the custodian provides information specific to the proposed
project. The questions for each section of Part B are:

1.  Project Description

 • Has a summary of the proposed project been prepared, including a description of the

needs behind the development of the project and how the proposed project will meet those
needs? Enclose the summary.

 • Has a listing of all health information or data elements to be collected, used or disclosed in

the project been prepared? Enclose the listing.
This section of Part B identifies and traces health information from the point of collection
to the point where all copies of the information are destroyed or permanently archived. It
should include the following steps:
–  group the data elements into registration information and diagnostic, treatment and

care information;

–  identify the information source – whether the information is collected directly from

each individual by the business or program area responsible for the initiative; from an
internal information system within the custodian; or from an external source;

–  identify the rationale for each data element collected (e.g., needed for identification,

contact, to verify eligibility, etc.);

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

–  indicate the degree of anonymity of the health information being collected to carry out
the intended purpose(s) (e.g., aggregate, non‑identifying, individually identifying);

–  if individually identifying health information is collected, explain why aggregate or non‑
identifying health information is not adequate for the intended purpose(s) (section 57);
and

–  describe the process(es) used to determine the amount of personal health information

collected (e.g., the data elements and the target population) (section 58).

 • Have diagrams been prepared showing the flow of health information for this project? If so,

provide the diagram(s).
The information flow diagram could be a flow chart or schematic or a structured analysis
of a series of progressive steps in a program, broken down according to function. The
diagram should illustrate how health information is collected, how it circulates within the
custodian(s) and how it is disseminated beyond the custodian(s).

 • Have documents been prepared showing which persons, positions or affiliate categories
will have access to which elements of health information and where copies of records
accessed or used may exist? Enclose the documents.
This will illustrate the need‑to‑know principle. This information may be able to be
incorporated into the information flow diagram.

2.  Authority for Collection, Use and Disclosure of Health Information

The custodian needs to analyze the proposed information flows against the rules in the
Health Information Act regarding collection, use, disclosure, protection, accuracy, retention
and disposition of health information as well as the right of access and the right to request
a correction or amendment to an individual’s health information. Has the legal authority for
the collection, use and disclosure of all personal information for this project been established?
Enclose statutory provisions.

Collection of Health Information (Sections 19 & 20)

 • Is individually identifying health information being collected?
 • What is the legal authority for the collection? (attach statutory references, if any)
 • Has only necessary health information been collected (on a need to know basis)?
 • Is the information being collected at the highest level of anonymity possible and in a

limited manner (sections 57 & 58)?

Collection of Personal Health Number (Section 21)

 • What authority requires individuals to provide their personal health number (if this needs

to be collected)?

Manner of Collection of Health Information (Section 22)

 • Is individually identifying health information collected directly from the individuals it

is about?

 • How will affected individuals be notified of the legal authority for and purpose(s) for the

collection as well as the contact information (section 22(3))?

and complete (section 61)?

Disclosure of Health Information (Sections 34 – 45)

 • Is individually identifying health information being disclosed?
 • Will this be an ad hoc or one‑time disclosure of information or will the disclosure be on a

planned (or regular) basis?

 • Who will the records containing this information be disclosed to or who will have access
to them? Will they have full access or limited access? (e.g., different levels of access to
portions of a database or data warehouse)

 • Is a new record containing health information created as a result of the disclosure?
 • Have all the anticipated disclosures of individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and

care information been identified and authorized under sections 34, 35 or 39?

 • Is information on disclosures of individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care

information maintained (section 41)?

 • Have all the anticipated disclosures of registration information been identified and

authorized under section 36?

 • If there is an anticipated disclosure of individually identifying health information to the

Minister, is there authority to disclose under section 40?

 • How will the recipient of individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care

information be notified of the purpose of the disclosure and the authority under which
the disclosure is made if the disclosure is to a person or organization other than those in
section 42(2)?

 • How will the custodian disclosing the health information ensure that the person to whom
the disclosure is made is the person intended and authorized to receive the information
(section 45)?

(section 72)?
Note that the definition of “health information” in Division 3 (sections 49 – 56) of the Act
(disclosure for research purposes) refers to individually identifying diagnostic, treatment
and care information or individually identifying registration information, or both. Even
though a research ethics board review may have been conducted under section 50, the
disclosure of individually identifying health information would still require a PIA to be
conducted. However, the portions of the assessment done by the research ethics board
related to security safeguards could be used in the PIA.

3.  Privacy Risk Assessment

The custodian identifies the potential privacy risks of the project and shows whether those
risks have been successfully addressed through system design or policy measures or through
other proposed options for mitigation. The residual risks that cannot be addressed through the
proposed options should also be identified. Where possible, the likely implications of those
risks in terms of public reaction and project success should be analyzed.

 • Will personal information collected or used in the project be disclosed to any persons who

are not affiliates?

 • Will this project involve the collection, use or disclosure of any health information beyond

Alberta’s borders? Provide details (see Duty to Protect above).

 • Has the project’s potential risks to privacy been assessed? Provide details in an enclosure.
This involves identifying, from the perspective of the individuals who are the subjects of
the health information, how the project may affect their privacy interests.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

 • If potential risks to privacy have been identified, have means to avert or mitigate those

risks been incorporated into the project design?

 • Have key stakeholders been provided with an opportunity to comment on the privacy

protection implications of the project? Provide the results of consultation, if any.

 • Are project affiliates trained in the requirements for projecting health information and

aware of the relevant policies regarding breaches of security or confidentiality? Describe the

5.  Audit and Enforcement

 • Have arrangements been made for audit, compliance and enforcement mechanisms for the

project, including fulfillment of the commitments made in the PIA?
The custodian needs to show how it will demonstrate its compliance with the Health
Information Act and its own commitments.
Include information about how often an audit will be conducted, who is responsible for the
audit, and how any identified privacy issues will be addressed.

Privacy Impact Assessments Before Data Matching

Under section 69, a custodian may perform data matching using information that is in its
custody or under its control. If the data matching is being conducted for an authorized purpose
(under section 27(1) or (2)) and does not relate to a new or modified administrative practice
or information system that may affect the privacy of the individual who is the subject of the
information, a PIA under section 64 would not be required.

Under section 70(2), before a custodian performs data matching by combining information
in its custody or under its control with information in the custody or under the control of
another custodian a PIA must be prepared by the custodian in whose custody and control the
information created by the data matching will be stored. The PIA must be submitted to the
Commissioner for review and comment.

The PIA must:

 • describe how the information to be used in the data matching is to be collected; and
 • set out how the information that is created through data matching is to be used

or disclosed.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

Under section 71(2), before a custodian performs data matching by combining information in
its custody or under its control with information that is in the custody or under the control of
a non‑custodian, a PIA must be prepared by the custodian and submitted to the Commissioner
for review and comment.

The PIA must:

 • describe how the information to be used in the data matching is to be collected; and
 • set out how the information that is created through data matching is to be used

or disclosed.

Under section 72, before data matching is performed for the purpose of conducting research
using individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information sections 49 to 56
must be complied with.

When a Research Ethics Board (REB) reviews and approves a researcher’s proposal to conduct
data matching for the purpose of research, there is no specific requirement that a PIA be
prepared. Custodians have the option to impose additional conditions on the researcher
prior to disclosing information where data matching is performed for the purpose of
conducting research.

For Example, a custodian may require a PIA to be completed and forwarded to the
Commissioner for review and comment prior to disclosing the information. Or a custodian
may choose to complete a PIA over and above the REB review required for research purposes
and may base the release of information, in part, on the outcome of the PIA process. A PIA
conducted for this specific purpose may be limited in scope.

For more discussion of Data Matching Rules, refer to section 5.4 in this Chapter. For
more discussion of Disclosure for Research Purposes, refer to section 8.15 of Chapter 8 of
this Publication.

Privacy Impact Assessments Before Disclosure of Health Information to Minister and
Department (Section 46)

Under section 46(5), if the Minister or Department of Alberta Health and Wellness request(s)
another custodian to disclose individually identifying health information relating to a health
service provided by the other custodian that is:

 • fully or partially paid for by the Department; or
 • provided using financial, physical or human resources provided, administered or paid for

by the Department;

 • the Department must consider the comments of the Commissioner, if any, made in

response to the privacy impact assessment before disclosing the health information to a
custodian referred to in section 1(1)(f)(iii) or (iv).

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

 5.3

POWERS OF CUSTODIANS

The powers of custodians are set out in Part 6 of the Act (Powers and Duties of Custodians
Relating to Health Information). They include the power to transform individually identifying
health information to create non‑identifying health information; the power to enter agreements
with information managers; and the power to charge fees for producing a copy of an
individual’s health information.

These powers are related to two of the fundamental purposes of the Health Information Act:
establishing strong and effective mechanisms to protect the privacy and confidentiality of an
individual’s health information (section 2(a)) and providing individuals with a right of access
to health information about themselves (section 2(d)).

 5.3.1

POWER TO TRANSFORM HEALTH INFORMATION

Collecting health information in identifying form helps ensure that information collected
over time relates to the same individual. However, if the end use of the information does not
require knowledge of the identity of the individual, the highest degree of anonymity principle
in the Act (section 57(2) places a duty on custodians to change individually identifying health
information into non‑identifying information.

The collection, use and disclosure of health information in electronic form and the use of
information system tools allows custodians to transform individually identifying information
into non‑identifying or anonymous information as a means of protecting the privacy
of individuals.

Under section 65, a custodian may, in accordance with the regulations, strip, encode or
otherwise transform individually identifying health information to create non‑identifying health
information. (Note that no regulations have been developed under the Act as yet). Section 66
requires custodians to enter into an agreement with an information manager to perform the
transformation function. (See section 5.3.2 of this Chapter for a discussion about the content
of such agreements.)

Definition of Terms
“Anonymous information” refers to either aggregate or individual anonymous information.

“Non-identifying health information” is defined in section 1(1)(r) to mean that the identity
of the individual who is the subject of the information cannot be readily ascertained from
the information.

“Individually identifying health information” is defined in section 1(1)(p) to mean that the
identity of the individual who is the subject of the information can be readily ascertained form
the information.

“Anonymity” refers to the characteristic of being non‑identifying. That is, the identity of the
individual to whom it pertains cannot be readily ascertained.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

“Anonymity transformation” refers to the process of taking individually identifying health
information and rendering it non‑identifying.

“Stripping” refers to the technique or process of removing names and personal identifiers from
records that were identifiable. The resulting records are essentially anonymous when viewed in
isolation from other contextual information. However, information representing distinguishing
characteristics may be sufficient to re‑identify the individual when compared with other
information sources which have both the distinguishing characteristics and the names.

“Encrypting” refers to the technique or process of transforming information from human
readable form to a meaningless form using a computational algorithm. Encryption can be
used for an entire record of information, in which case it must be decrypted before it can be
used at all. Secure applications decrypt the information prior to providing access to authorized
individuals performing specific activities.

Encryption can be used to transform a personal identifier to a unique, but anonymous
identifier. Anonymous identifiers allow processing of discrete person level records to analyze
information across time, data sources or geographical areas for such purposes as measuring
utilization, health system performance, and health outcomes or program evaluation.

“Re-coding” refers to the technique or process of transforming a very specific value for a data
element to one which is meaningful but less precise. An example would be to transform a birth
date to an age at a point in time. Re‑coding is useful when the purpose for which information
is desired does not require the same degree of specificity as the purpose for which the
information was first recorded.

“Abstracting” refers to the technique or process of transforming information by selecting
only the relevant aspects from a complete set of information. This process is useful when the
purpose for which the information is desired does not require the full set available and meets
the principle of minimum amount of information used for each specific purpose.

“Aggregating” refers to the technique or process of transforming information about individuals
into information about groups of individuals with common characteristics. An example would
be statistical tables that count the number of individuals falling into specific groups. However,
if there are only a small number of individuals within a certain category, they may be able to
be identified by context.

“Deriving” refers to the technique or process of transforming specific elements of information
into a new piece of information through a mathematical calculation. The derived element of
information may be more meaningful to a particular purpose and also less likely to reveal
identity than the specific elements from which it was derived. An example would be the length
of stay in a facility that can be derived from the difference between the date of admission and
the date of discharge. Both the admission date and the discharge date can be used to identify a
record of an individual even though the identity had been encrypted or stripped if compared to
a source of information which contained both dates and names.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

“Readily ascertained” in the context of section 57, means that the identity of an individual
(e.g., the individual’s name or other identifiers or distinguishing characteristics associated with
an individual) can be determined or deduced without having to apply a sophisticated technical
method or process, or without having the particular technical expertise to do so.

The identity of an individual can be said to be “readily ascertained” if:

 • it can be determined by combining available data or information within the same or in

several different records held by the same custodian;

 • it can be determined by comparing information representing distinguishing characteristics

with other information sources having both the distinguishing characteristics and the
names or other identifiers of individuals; and

 • if only readily available or conventional computer hardware, software and technical

expertise is used.

Anonymity transformation techniques can be used in combination to achieve the greatest
degree of anonymity with the least amount of information to meet a specific purpose.
The context of use must be taken into consideration when selecting which transformation
techniques to use. Information intended for public disclosure should be carefully examined
after transformation to ensure that identity cannot be inferred from available context.

In order to comply with section 65, custodians should:

 • provide non‑identifying health information (either a view or a unique data set) to affiliates
who have no requirement to access or use individually identifying information to meet
their responsibilities;
Although a custodian may collect health information in individually identifying form, if an
affiliate does not need to access or use individually identifying information to meet his/
her/its responsibilities, the custodian must transform the identifying information into non‑
identifying form prior to use by that affiliate.
For affiliates with multi‑task roles, some of their roles may require access to or use
of individually identifying information. However, the need to know principle would
continue to apply to these affiliates so that they would only access individually identifying
information when that was necessary to carry out a particular role.

BEST PRACTICE: Many purposes can be supported with the same anonymous information.
Custodians could apply stripping and encryption techniques on the obvious individually identifying
information but leave the other information in its originally collected form. The anonymous multi-
purpose information could be stored separately from the information in identifiable form.

Affiliates accessing anonymous information must be aware of the degree of anonymity provided
by different techniques and should ensure that the principles of limited information at the highest
degree of anonymity are consistently applied. Further transformation techniques may need to be
applied to produce information appropriate for a specific purpose.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

 • disclose only non‑identifying health information to other custodians who have no
requirement to collect or use individually identifying information to meet their
responsibilities;
If another custodian does not need individually identifying information to carry out its
purpose, the disclosing custodian should transform the information into non‑identifying
information before disclosing it for the other custodian’s intended use.

BEST PRACTICE: If multiple custodians are collecting the same information from one custodian and
only need non-identifying information, the coordination of anonymity transformation might require
the services of an information manager to produce comprehensive non-identifying information (under
section 66). If this is not the case, the techniques used for anonymity transformation would be similar to
those employed by the collecting custodian for its own use.

Custodians should be able to demonstrate to the Commissioner upon review that necessity for the
intended purpose was considered and that non-identifying information was disclosed.

 • disclose only non‑identifying health information to non‑custodians who have

no requirement or authority to collect or use health information in individually
identifying form;
The transformation techniques used prior to disclosing health information to a non‑
custodian should be chosen to produce the required degree of specificity of both
information content and amount of information to meet the purpose while still reducing
the risk of revealing identity.
When a custodian discloses a record set containing non‑identifying information to a non‑
custodian, the custodian must tell the recipient (in accordance with section 32(2)) that the
Commissioner has to be notified if the non‑custodian intends to use the information for
data matching. The Commissioner has to be notified of this intent before the data matching
is performed.

BEST PRACTICE: The more a recipient knows about a group of individuals, the greater is the risk that
identity can be inferred from non-identifying information about that same group of individuals.
Additional transformation techniques such as sampling, random rounding for aggregate measures
representing small populations, or adjusting the specificity of information disclosed about
anonymous individuals help to minimize the risk.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

Anonymity Transformation Performed by an Information Manager
When non‑identifying information is going to be used to compile population level information,
the information needs to be produced in a comprehensive and coordinated manner. To
accomplish this, individually identifying health information could be disclosed to an
information manager to apply a common anonymity transformation technique. The resulting
non‑identifying records can then be analyzed across custodians to produce useful longitudinal
results leading to program evaluation, health outcome measures or other statistics impossible
to produce with fragmented information.

Different encryption algorithms can be used to produce population level information
for different purposes. Purpose specific encryption enables coordinated, comprehensive
information to be produced while not violating the principle of collecting and using the
minimum amount of information needed to meet the purpose.

BEST PRACTICE: If Information Managers are used to transform individually identifying health
information into non-identifying information, the requirements of section 66 must be followed.
The custodian must enter into an agreement with the Information Manager, in accordance with
the regulations. The transformations must be done in such a way that accumulation of anonymous
information does not risk revealing identity.

The Minister, the Department, and a regional health authority will have to develop appropriate
processes and policies to manage transformation, access to and disclosure of non-identifying
information.

When developing new or significantly modifying automated information systems, a privacy impact
assessment must be conducted. This could identify opportunities to use anonymity transformation
techniques. The assessment should also identify whether anonymity transformation must be
coordinated with other custodians to meet the specified purposes.

 5.3.2  AGREEMENT WITH INFORMATION MANAGER

Custodians are required, under section 66(2), to enter agreements with Information
Managers, in accordance with the regulations (note there is currently no regulation related
to this power), to perform any of the following functions or to provide any of the following
information technology services:

 • process, store, retrieve or dispose of health information;
 • in accordance with the regulations, strip, encode or otherwise transform, individually

identifying health information to create non‑identifying health information; or

 • provide information management or information technology services.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

Section 7.2 of the Health Information Regulation sets out contents that must be included in the
information manager agreement (IMA), which are required by section 66(2) of HIA:

 • the IMA must identify the objectives of the agreement and the principles to guide the

agreement;
–  whether the information manager (IM) is permitted to collect health information from
any other custodian or from an individual and if so, a description of that information
and the purposes for which it may be collected;

–  whether the IM may use health information provided to it by the custodian and if so, a

description of that information and the purposes for which it may be used;

–  whether the IM may disclose health information provided to it by the custodian and if
so, a description of that information and the purpose for which it may be disclosed;

–  the process for the IM to respond to access requests or for the IM to refer access

requests to the custodian;

–  the process for the IM to respond to requests to amend or correct health information;
–  where applicable, how the IM should address an individual’s express wish relating to

the disclosure of health information; and

–  how health information is to be protected, managed, returned, or destroyed by the IM

in accordance with HIA.

“Information Manager” means a person or body that performs one or more of the functions or
provides one or more of the services above (as described in section 66(1)).

In OIPC IR H2008‑IR‑002, the OIPC concluded that information manager agreements must not
contain provisions excusing compliance with the HIA.

The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) and Alberta Health and Wellness would be
examples of information managers. A company that provides a billing service to physicians in
a clinic would also be an information manager although the information would probably be
limited to billing information.

Information Managers, like other affiliates, fall within the controlled arena for sharing
individually identifying health information. Because of the special nature of the information
management services that they provide and the associated security requirements, the
agreements with information managers will have special requirements. The Minister may, in
the future, put these requirements into a regulation authorized by section 108(2)(b).

(See section 5.3.1 of this Chapter for a discussion about “transforming information” and
definitions for “stripping” and “encoding”.)

After a custodian has entered into an agreement under section 66(2), the custodian may
provide health information to the Information Manager without the consent of the individuals
who are the subjects of the information for the purposes authorized by the agreement
(section 66(3)).

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

An Information Manager may use the information provided by the custodian (under
section 66(3)) only for the purposes authorized by the agreement (section 66(4)). The
Information Manager must comply with the Act and the regulations as well as the agreement
entered into with the custodian (section 66(5)). It is an offence under the Act for an
Information Manager to knowingly breach the terms and conditions of such an agreement
(section 107(4)).

An Information Manager may disclose health information to the custodian that provided
the information to the Information Manager. An Information Manager may disclose health
information to a custodian other than the custodian that provided the information to the
Information Manager only if the Information Manager has been appointed as an affiliate of
that (or those) other custodian(s) and only as authorized by the custodian, according to the
disclosure rules and processes outlined in the Act and the agreement.

However, it is important for custodians to understand that they continue to be responsible
for complying with the Act and the regulations respecting the information that they have
provided to the Information Manager (section 66(6)). This includes their responsibilities
under section 58 (collecting, using and disclosing the least amount of information needed
for the intended purpose). In order to satisfy these responsibilities under that section, a
custodian must:

 • minimize the health information that the custodian contributes to the database;
 • implement security precautions to restrict access to information in the database by

participating custodians or structure the database so that participating custodians do not
have direct access to it; and

 • obtain the advice and recommendations of the Information and Privacy Commissioner

before the database is operational.

See IR H2008-IR-002: The Office of the OIPC concluded that custodians are ultimately
responsible for the actions of their information managers. However, information managers
must also do their part to comply with the HIA.

BEST PRACTICE: Agreements with Information Managers and the related policies and procedures
of the custodian need to allow the custodian to monitor and periodically audit the performance
of the Information Manager under the agreement to ensure compliance with these requirements.
There should also be provision for remedies such as cancellation of the agreement in the event that
the Information Manager fails to meet its terms and conditions or fails to comply with the Act or the
regulations.

Information to an Information Manager.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

Canadian Institute for Health Information
The Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI) is a national, federally chartered, not‑
for‑profit organization responsible for developing and maintaining a comprehensive health
information system for Canada. CIHI works toward improving the health of Canadians and the
health system by providing quality and timely health information to: advance Canada’s health
policies, improve the health of the population, strengthen the health system, and assist leaders
in the health sector make informed decisions. CIHI does not provide health services, but
supports the health system by producing health information for management decision making.

Based on a signed agreement, CIHI is an Information Manager for the Minister and the health
authority. The responsibilities and obligations of CIHI as an Information Manager are outlined
in the agreement between CIHI and the Minister.

Health information is currently sent to CIHI directly from the Department of Alberta Health and
Wellness and the health authority or indirectly from the health authority via the Department
of Alberta Health and Wellness. CIHI edits the data and uses it to populate its databases. The
data collected from Alberta and maintained in the CIHI databases is used by CIHI for the
purpose of approved research and analysis of health utilization and management. The use of
this data is consistent with the uses identified in the agreement. CIHI has policies respecting
disclosure of data and does not provide access to Alberta identifiable data without the approval
of the Minister.

In compliance with the Health Information Act and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of its agreement with the Minister, CIHI:

 • collects individually identifying health information only as authorized;
 • uses individually identifying health information only as authorized;
 • obtains individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information and registration

information from other custodians without consent only as authorized;

 • discloses individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information and

registration information only as authorized;

 • maintains privacy and confidentiality and follows policies and procedures as negotiated

with the Minister;

 • is subject to the oversight of the Information and Privacy Commissioner;
 • grants individuals access to their health information directly from the Department of

Alberta Health and Wellness; and

 • cooperates and complies with all orders issued by the Information and Privacy

Commissioner.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

Health Services Databases Maintained by CIHI

 • Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) and Hospital Morbidity Database (HMD)

The Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) is a database for information related to hospital
inpatient and day surgery events. This patient‑specific database contains clinical,
demographic (gender, date of birth, postal code, hospital number, personal health number)
and administrative data on patient discharge including the most responsible physician
and diagnosis, the principle procedure performed, and admission discharge data (e.g.,
admission category, length of stay). All provinces provide data for inclusion in the Hospital
Morbidity Database, while reporting data for inclusion in the DAD is optional. Since
Alberta facilities provide data for DAD, CIHI also uses this data to populate the Hospital
Morbidity Database. This identifiable data is collected at the facility level and sent to CIHI
on a monthly basis. Data is generally submitted electronically.

 • Canadian Organ Replacement Register (CORR)

The Canadian Organ Replacement Register (CORR) records, analyzes and reports on the
level of activity and outcomes of vital organ transplantation and renal dialysis activities in
Canada. This database contains patient‑specific data on organ transplantation data (heart,
lung, liver, kidney and pancreas) and renal replacement activities. Patient demographics
(including name, date of birth, and PHN), treatments received (dialysis and/or transplant),
risk factors, and follow‑up on graft failures and deaths are also included. Data comes from
individuals through the completion of patient‑specific forms and also through a facility
survey. In Alberta, this data is collected at the University of Alberta Hospital and Alberta
Health Services (from the HOPE Program) and forwarded directly from the RHA level
to CIHI.

 • Hospital Mental Health Database (HMHDB)

The Hospital Mental Health Database (HMHDB) is based on inpatient events only and
excludes patients treated in residential care facilities. Data consists of demographics (age,
sex, birth date) and medical diagnosis information. This data is downloaded from DAD if
the facilities already report to DAD.

 • National Trauma Registry (NTR)

The National Trauma Registry (NTR) provides national statistics on injuries in Canada.
The NTR contains demographic, diagnostic and procedural information on all acute care
hospital admissions due to injury. The Minimal Data Set and the Comprehensive Data Set
are extracted from the Hospital Morbidity Database.

 • Therapeutic Abortions Database (TADB)

The Therapeutic Abortions Database (TADB) contains patient identifiable demographic
information including age and province of residence, medical data including days of care,
initial surgical procedure, and sterilization procedure. This data is manually collected at
the facility and forwarded to Alberta Health and Wellness. Alberta Health and Wellness
converts the data to electronic form. On an annual basis, the data is sent to CIHI on
tape. (Individuals obtaining this service as an in‑patient would also be reported through
the DAD.)

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

 • National Rehabilitation Reporting System (NRS)

The National Rehabilitation Reporting System (NRS) contains client data collected
from participating inpatient rehabilitation facilities and programs. The NRS contains
inpatient rehabilitation admission, discharge and follow‑up assessments, including socio‑
demographic information, administrative data, health characteristics and activities and
participation. Data is collected at the time of admission and discharge by service providers
in participating facilities.

 • Continuing Care Reporting System (CCRS)

The Continuing Care Reporting System (CCRS) collects and reports information on
residents of publicly funded continuing care facilities in Canada. The data elements include
demographics, health conditions, cognitive, behavioral and physical function, treatments
and procedures, admission and discharge data and facility size, type and location. This
data is provided by Alberta Health Services or facilities directly.

 • Home Care Reporting System (HCRS)

The Home Care Reporting System (HCRS) collects and reports information on clients who
receive publicly funded home care in Canada. The data elements include demographics,
health condition, cognitive, behavioral and physical function, treatments, procedures, and
informal care, referral and discharge data and dates for calculation of waiting times. This
data is provided by Alberta Health Services.

 • Canadian Joint Replacement Registry (CJRR)

The Canadian Joint Replacement Registry (CJRR) captures information on hip and knee
joint replacements performed in Canada. The patient related data includes demographics
and administration, the type of replacement, and surgical approach. The joint replacement
data is available from the Hospital Morbidity Database (HMD).

 • National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System (NPDUIS)

The National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System is designed to provide data
in the critical analyses of drug utilization, cost trends and drug prices so that Canada’s
health system has more comprehensive, accurate information on how prescription drugs
are being used and sources of cost increases. The data includes plan information (e.g.,
eligibility information, plan rules), formulary data (e.g., listing of drugs covered, benefit
criteria), and drug utilization (e.g., drug‑claim data).

 5.3.3

POWER TO CHARGE FEES

Under section 67(1), custodians have the power to charge the fees set out in the Health
Information Regulation for services provided under Part 2 of the Act (Individual’s Right
to Access Individual’s Health Information). The fees apply to the processing of requests
by an applicant for access to a record containing health information. In accordance with
section 67(2) of the Act and section 9 of the Regulation, they include both a basic fee of $25.00
for performing the steps involved in producing a copy of the information, and additional fees in
accordance with the Fee Schedule in the Regulation. The basic fee is called an initial fee under
the FOIP Act but only applies to access to general records, not to personal information, under
that Act.

Section 67(3) says that a custodian must give an applicant an estimate of the total fee for its
services before providing the services. Section 10 of the Regulation sets out what needs to be
included in a fee estimate and gives an applicant up to 20 days to indicate if the fee estimate is
accepted or to modify the request to change the amount of fees assessed.

Section 12(1) of the regulation states that processing of a request ceases once a notice of
estimate has been forwarded to an applicant and starts again immediately upon the receipt of
an agreement to pay the fee and on the receipt of at least 50 per cent of any estimated fee. The
balance of any fee owing is payable at the time the information is delivered to the applicant
(section 11(2) of the regulation).

Section 67(6) says that the fees must not exceed the actual cost of the service. If the amount
paid is higher than the actual cost of the service, all or part of the fees will be refunded by the
custodian (section 12(3) of the Regulation).

Section 67(4) allows a custodian to excuse an applicant from paying all or part of a fee if,
in the custodian’s opinion, the applicant cannot afford the fee or in any other circumstances
provided for in the regulations. For the purposes of this section of the Act, section 12 of the
regulation permits a custodian to excuse an applicant from paying all or part of a fee if, in the
opinion of the custodian, it is fair to excuse payment.

If the custodian refuses an applicant’s request to excuse the payment of all or part of a
fee, the custodian must notify the applicant that the applicant may ask for a review by the
Commissioner (section 67(5)).

For a more detailed discussion on Estimating, Assessing and Excusing Fees, see section 2.5.8
of Chapter 2 of this publication.

DATA MATCHING RULES

Division 2 of Part 6 of the Act (Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health
Information – Data Matching) enables custodians and health information repositories to
perform data matching. However, because of the possibility of taking otherwise non‑identifying
health information and combining it creates information that potentially identifies individuals,
that Division sets out specific rules and controls over data matching.

“Data matching” is defined in section 1(1)(g) of the Act to mean the creation of individually
identifying health information by combining individually identifying or non‑identifying health
information or other information from 2 or more electronic databases, without the consent of
the individuals who are the subjects of the information.

Related to data matching is “data linkage” or “data profiling” which is a computerized use of
health information and other personal data from a variety of sources, to merge and compare
files on identifiable individuals or categories of individuals. This linkage or profiling creates a
new body of health information.

 5.4.1  GENERAL PROHIBITION RESPECTING DATA MATCHING

Under section 68, a custodian or health information repository must not collect the health
information to be used in data matching, or use or disclose the health information to be used
in data matching or created through data matching in contravention of the Act.

It is an offence under section 107(2)(a) for any person to knowingly collect, use, disclose or
create health information in contravention of this Act.

There must be authority for the collection, use or disclosure of individually identifying health
information being used for data matching or that is being created as a result of the data
matching.

Some of the matters that should be considered before and during any data matching
project are:

 • Is there a data matching policy and guidelines in place within the custodian or health

information repository? Have they been followed?

 • Has the data matching been authorized by an appropriate designated official within the

custodian or health information repository?

 • Will the information generated or created by the matching program be verified against

original or additional authoritative sources before the information is used for an
administrative purpose, especially if it impacts an individual?

 • Has there been an assessment of the advantages of the proposed matching against

alternative control, management or enforcement approaches?

 • Has there been an assessment of how the information is to be collected and how the

information created through the data matching is to be used and disclosed?

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

 5.4.2  DATA MATCHING WITHIN A CUSTODIAN OR HEALTH INFORMATION

REPOSITORY

A custodian or health information repository may perform data matching using information
that is in its custody or under its control (section 69). There is no requirement in the Act to
prepare a privacy impact assessment for this type of data matching, provided the data matching
is being done for an authorized purpose (section 27) and will not result in a use of individually
identifying health information that will affect the privacy of the individual who is the subject of
the information.

 5.4.3  DATA MATCHING BETWEEN CUSTODIANS OR HEALTH INFORMATION

REPOSITORIES

However, if a custodian or health information repository wishes to perform data matching by
combining information that is in its custody or under its control with information that is in the
custody or under the control of another custodian or health information repository it must meet
the requirements of section 70(2) and (3). The requirements are:

 • Before performing data matching, the custodian in whose custody and control the

information that is created through data matching will be stored must prepare a privacy
impact assessment and submit the assessment to the Commissioner for review and
comment; and

 • The privacy impact assessment must describe how the information to be used in the data
matching is to be collected, and set out how the information that is created through data
matching is to be used or disclosed.

Section 70(3) sets the minimum requirements for PIAs for data matching projects. Custodians
should follow the PIA process set out in section 5.2.7 of this Chapter.

 5.4.4  DATA MATCHING BETWEEN A CUSTODIAN OR HEALTH INFORMATION

REPOSITORY AND A NON-CUSTODIAN OR NON-HEALTH INFORMATION
REPOSITORY

If a custodian or health information repository wishes to perform data matching by combining
information that is in its custody or under its control with information that is in the custody
or under the control of a non‑custodian or a non‑health information repository, the custodian
or health information repository must meet the requirements in section 71(2) and (3). The
requirements are:

 • Before performing data matching, the custodian or health information repository must

prepare a privacy impact assessment and submit the assessment to the Commissioner for
review and comment; and

 • The privacy impact assessment must describe how the information to be used in the data
matching is to be collected, and set out how the information that is created through data
matching is to be used or disclosed.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

If a non‑custodian or non‑health Information repository wants to collect individually
identifying health information for a data matching purpose, the disclosing custodian must
follow the rules under the Health Information Act for such a disclosure.

It is an offence under section 107(5) for a person who receives non‑identifying health
information and who intends to use the information to perform data matching, to fail to
comply with section 32(2). Under that section, the disclosing custodian must inform the
person that the person must notify the Commissioner of an intention to use the information for
data matching, before performing the data matching.

 5.4.5  DATA MATCHING FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES

Under section 72, if data matching is performed for the purpose of conducting research,
sections 48 to 56 must be complied with before the data matching is performed. A custodian
must determine if a privacy impact assessment is required. Sections 49 to 56 require the
review, by the Research Ethics Board, of a research proposal for the disclosure of health
information, including an assessment of public interest, privacy impacts and security
safeguards; an application to the custodian for disclosure of health information for research
purposes; and the terms and conditions of an agreement that must be entered into with the
researcher.

Refer to section 5.2.7 of this Chapter for a detailed discussion of the Duty to Prepare Privacy
Impact Assessments and to section 8.15 of Chapter 8 for a discussion on Disclosure for
Research Purposes.

CHAPTER FIVE –Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

THI NGS TO REMEMB ER

DUTIES AND POWERS OF CUSTODIANS RELATING TO HEALTH INFORMATION

 • The duties of custodians encompass a set of fair information practices for health

information. They apply throughout the Act to all custodians and to their affiliates.

 • A custodian must collect, use and disclose health information at the highest level
of anonymity possible. A custodian must first consider whether aggregate health
information or non‑identifying health information would be adequate for the
intended purpose. If neither level of anonymity would be adequate for the intended
purpose, the custodian may collect, use or disclose individually identifying health
information if it is authorized by the Health Information Act and is carried out in
accordance with the Act. The duty to collect, use or disclose health information at
the highest level of anonymity does not apply where collection, use or disclosure is
for the purpose of providing a health service or determining eligibility.

 • Anonymous health information means either aggregate or individual anonymous

information.

 • Aggregate health information means non‑identifying health information about

groups of individuals with common characteristics.

 • Non‑identifying health information means that the identity of the individual who is
the subject of the information cannot be readily ascertained from the information.
 • Individually identifying health information means that the identity of the individual

who is the subject of the information can be readily ascertained from the
information.

 • The identity of an individual can be said to be readily ascertained if:

–  an individual’s identity can be determined by combining available data or

information within the same or in several different records held by the same
custodian;

–  an individual’s identity can be determined by comparing information

representing distinguishing characteristics with other information sources having
both the distinguishing characteristics and the names or other identifiers of
individuals; and only readily available or conventional computer hardware,
software and technical expertise is used.

 • A custodian may use processes to transform individually identifying health

information to make it non‑identifying (e.g., stripping identifiers, encrypting,
aggregating information, etc.).

 • A custodian must enter into an agreement with an information manager (a

special type of affiliate) to process, store, retrieve, dispose of or transform health
information or to provide information management or information technology
services. (See Components for an Agreement with an Information Manager in
Appendix 4 of this Publication).

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

 • A custodian that has entered into an agreement with an information manager may
disclose health information to the information manager without the consent of
individual subjects for the purposes authorized by the agreement.

 • A custodian must collect, use or disclose only the amount of health information
essential to enable the custodian or recipient to carry out the intended purpose.
 • In deciding how much health information to disclose, a custodian must consider
any expressed wishes of the individual relating to disclosure of the information
together with any other relevant factors.

 • A custodian must take reasonable steps to maintain administrative, technical and
physical safeguards to ensure compliance with the Act by the custodian and its
affiliates and to protect:
–  the confidentiality of health information in its custody or under its control and

the privacy of the individual subjects;

–  the confidentiality of health information that is to be stored or used outside

Alberta or that is to be disclosed by the custodian to a person outside Alberta
and the privacy of the individual subjects (unless the health information is
used solely for the purpose of providing continuing treatment or care to the
individual); and

–  against any reasonably anticipated threat or hazard to the security or integrity of
the information or of loss of health information or unauthorized access to, use,
disclosure or modification of the health information.

 • A custodian must maintain safeguards to address risks associated with electronic

health records and proper disposal of records to prevent any reasonably anticipated
unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of the health information.

 • In order to assess the level and type of safeguards needed to protect health

information, a custodian should conduct a threat and risk assessment of the health
information in its custody or under its control. (See Chapter 11 of this Publication
for Conducting a Threat and Risk Assessment).

 • A custodian should establish a health information security policy and ensure

that its affiliates are aware of and comply with the policy. (See Chapter 11 of this
publication for the Components of a Health Information Security Policy).

 • Before using or disclosing health information in its custody or control, a custodian

must make reasonable efforts to ensure that the information is accurate and
complete.

 • A custodian must identify its affiliates who are responsible for ensuring that the Act,
the regulations and the policies and procedures of the custodian related to health
information are complied with.

 • A custodian must establish or adopt policies and procedures that will facilitate the

implementation of the Act and regulations.

CHAPTER FIVE – Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information

 • Any collection, use or disclosure of health information by an affiliate of a custodian

is a collection, use or disclosure by the custodian.

 • Any disclosure of health information to an affiliate of a custodian is a disclosure to

the custodian.

 • A custodian must prepare a privacy impact assessment whenever a proposed

change to an administrative practice or proposed new or modified information
system relating to the collection, use or disclosure of individually identifying health
information may affect the privacy of individual subjects. The privacy impact
assessment must be submitted to the Commissioner for review and comment before
the custodian implements the proposed practice or system. (See section 5.2.8 of
Chapter 5 regarding the Duty to Prepare Privacy Impact Assessments and Chapter
11 of this Publication for a Health Information Act Privacy Compliance Checklist).
 • “Data matching” means the creation of individually identifying health information
by combining individually identifying or non‑identifying health information or
other information from 2 or more electronic databases. Before matching health
information in its custody or control with information in the custody or under the
control of another custodian or non‑custodian, the custodian must prepare a privacy
impact assessment and submit it to the Commissioner for review and comment.
If the data matching is performed for research purposes, sections 49 to 56 of the
Act must be complied with and the custodian must determine if a privacy impact
assessment is required.

Section 6 of the HIA EHR Regulation requires custodians to ensure their Electronic
Health Record Information Systems (EHRIS) have capacity to create and maintain logs
containing the following information:

 • user identification and application identification associated with an access;
 • name of user and application that performs an access;
 • role or job functions of user who performs an access;
 • date of an access;
 • time of an access;
 • actions performed by a user during an access, including, without limitation,

creating, viewing, editing and deleting information;

 • name of facility or organization at which an access is performed;
 • display screen number or reference;
 • personal health number of the individual in respect of whom an access is

performed;

 • name of the individual in respect of whom an access is performed;
 • any other information required by the Minister.

This section applies only to electronic health information systems established after the
coming into force of this section.

Collection of Health Information

 6.1

OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER SIX

This Chapter will cover:

 • the limits on the collection of health information;
 • the duties of custodians collecting health information;
 • the collection of non‑identifying health information;
 • the authority to collect individually identifying health information;
 • the persons who can require individuals to provide their personal health number;
 • the duty to collect individually identifying health information directly from the individual it

is about;

 • the authority for indirect collection of health information;
 • the requirement to obtain consent before using a recording device; and
 • the application of the ‘need to know’ principle to the collection of health information

by affiliates.

 6.2

LIMITS ON COLLECTION

The rules governing the collection of health information are found in Part 3 (Collection of
Health Information) of the Act (sections 18 to 24) and also within the duties of custodians
relating to health information in Part 6 of the Act (sections 57 and 58).

“Collect” means to gather, acquire, receive or obtain health information (section 1(1)(d)).
Collection can include activities such as taking a medical history; having individuals respond
through surveys, questionnaires or polling, or having individuals complete forms to provide
health information. The collection may be done through the provision of a health service,
in writing, by audio or video taping, by electronic data entry, over the telephone or by
other means.

Custodians are bound by the requirements of the Act whether the collection activities are
carried out by the custodian or by its affiliates.

CHAPTER SIX – Collection of Health Information

There are a number of specified limitations on collection in the Act, particularly those related
to the collection of individually identifying health information and also to the collection of
personal health numbers.

A general prohibition on the collection of health information is set out in section 18. That
section says that custodians must not collect health information except in accordance with
the Act.

 6.2.1  DUTY TO COLLECT HEALTH INFORMATION WITH THE HIGHEST DEGREE

OF ANONYMITY

Custodians collecting health information must consider the intended purpose for the collection
and the level of anonymity that is needed for that intended purpose. They must first consider
whether collection of aggregate health information will be adequate for the intended purpose
and if so, must collect only aggregate health information (section 57(2)).

“Aggregate health information” is defined in section 57(1) to mean non‑identifying health
information about groups of individuals.

If the custodian believes that collecting aggregate health information will not be adequate for
the custodian’s intended purpose, the custodian must then consider whether collection of
other non‑identifying health information is adequate for the intended purpose, and if so, the
custodian may collect other non‑identifying health information (section 57(3)).

“Non-identifying health information” is defined in section 1(1)(r) to mean that the identity
of the individual who is the subject of the information cannot be readily ascertained from
the information.

Under section 57(4), if the custodian believes that collecting aggregate and other non‑
identifying health information will not be adequate for the custodian’s intended purpose, the
custodian may collect individually identifying health information if the collection is:

 • authorized by the Health Information Act; and
 • carried out in accordance with the Health Information Act.

Under section 65, a custodian may strip, encode or otherwise transform individually identifying
health information to create non‑identifying health information.

“Individually identifying health information” is defined in section 1(1)(q) to mean that the
identity of the individual who is the subject of the information can be readily ascertained from
the information.

“Readily ascertained” in the context of section 57, means that the identity of an individual
(e.g., the individual’s name or other identifiers or distinguishing characteristics associated with
an individual) can be determined or deduced without having to apply a sophisticated technical
method or process, or without having the particular technical expertise to do so.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER SIX – Collection of Health Information

An individual’s identity can be said to be “readily ascertained” if his or her identity can be
determined by:

 • combining available information within the same or in several different records;
 • comparing information representing distinguishing characteristics with other information

sources having both the distinguishing characteristics and the names or other identifiers of
individuals; and

 • if only readily available or conventional computer hardware, software and technical

expertise is used.

Section 57 does not apply where the collection of health information is for the purpose of
providing a health service (as defined in section 1(1)(m)), or for determining the eligibility of
an individual to receive a health service.

See section 5.2.1 of Chapter 5 of this Publication for a more detailed discussion of this duty.

 6.2.2  DUTY TO COLLECT HEALTH INFORMATION IN A LIMITED MANNER

In addition to complying with section 57, custodians must collect only the amount of health
information that is essential to enable the custodian or the recipient of the information to carry
out the intended purpose (section 58(1)).

See section 5.2.2 of Chapter 5 of this Publication for a more detailed discussion of this duty.

 6.2.3  APPLYING THE ‘NEED TO KNOW’ PRINCIPLE TO THE COLLECTION OF

HEALTH INFORMATION BY AN AFFILIATE

The Health Information Act limits the authority of affiliates to collect health information. Under
section 24, an affiliate of a custodian must not collect health information in any manner that is
not in accordance with the affiliate’s duties to the custodian.

This means that unless the information is necessary for the affiliate to carry out his/her/its
designated responsibilities, the affiliate should not be collecting that information. This also
implies that custodians must identify the roles and responsibilities of their affiliates and ensure
that affiliates are informed about these duties and responsibilities.

Affiliates must also understand that their roles and responsibilities will limit the amount and
type of health information they will need to collect.

For example, a receptionist at the front counter of a clinic may only need to collect the name,
address, phone number and personal health number of a patient attending the clinic for the
first time. This would be needed to set up the patient’s chart and for billing purposes.

Depending upon the role of a physician’s nurse, the nurse might collect a history and other
basic health information such as the patient’s complaint or presenting symptoms, and height,
weight, blood pressure, etc.

The physician would collect a complete medical (and perhaps family and genetic) history.

CHAPTER SIX – Collection of Health Information

 6.3

COLLECTING NON-IDENTIFYING HEALTH INFORMATION

Custodians may collect non‑identifying health information for any purpose (section 19).

Practically speaking, health information is really only non‑identifying information if the
custodian or other person or entity receiving the information does not have other information
that could, in combination, identify an individual.

 6.4

AUTHORITY TO COLLECT INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFYING HEALTH INFORMATION

Under section 20, custodians may only collect individually identifying health information if:
 • the collection of that information is expressly authorized by an enactment of Alberta or

Canada; or

 • the information relates directly to and is necessary to enable the custodian to carry out a

purpose authorized under section 27.

Collection Expressly Authorized by an Enactment of Alberta or Canada
(section 20(a))
This means that a statute of Alberta or Canada or a regulation made under a federal or Alberta
statute provides for the collection of individually identifying health information. In some cases,
a statute both authorizes collection and identifies the health information that may be collected.
More commonly, the statute will authorize a program or activity to be carried out and a
regulation under the statute will authorize the collection of individually identifying health
information needed for the program or activity and sometimes the form or format in which the
information is to be collected.

An example of a statute authorizing collection of individually identifying health information
would be section 20 of the Public Health Act which requires individuals to consult with a
physician or attend a sexually transmitted disease clinic to determine if the individual is infected
or not if they know or have reason to believe they may have a communicable or sexually
transmitted disease. This section would authorize a custodian to collect individually identifying
health information to determine whether the individual has such a disease. The regulations
under the Act specify the diseases to which the requirement applies.

If an enactment authorizes a program or activity but there is no specific or express authority
for the collection of information for the purposes of the program or activity, a custodian cannot
rely on the enactment as authority for collection of the information.

The principles of collecting the least amount of information at the highest level of anonymity
continue to apply. Even if collection is authorized by another enactment, the custodian must
collect the least amount of information necessary and if identifying information is not needed
for the specific purpose, it must not be collected.

CHAPTER SIX – Collection of Health Information

Collection Necessary to Carry Out a Purpose Authorized under Section 27
(section 20(b))
If the individually identifying health information is directly related to and necessary for a
custodian to carry out a specific function outlined under section 27, the custodian is authorized
to collect it.

“Relates directly to” means that the individually identifying health information has a direct
bearing on the program or activity.

“Necessary for” means being able to demonstrate that individually identifying health
information is needed to carry out one of the functions or purposes under section 27.

The collection must meet both parts of the two‑part test above in order for a custodian to rely
on section 20(b) as authority for the collection.

Some of the purposes for which a custodian may collect individually identifying health
information as set out in section 27(1) include:

 • providing health services (“health service” is defined in section 1(1)(m));
 • determining eligibility to obtain health services;
 • investigating, reviewing or inspecting the services provided by health service providers

(e.g., for professional regulatory bodies and other review bodies to investigate complaints);

 • conducting research (note definition of “research” in section 1(1)(v));
 • providing health service provider education (e.g., for the creation of case studies for review

in medical grand rounds);

 • carrying out specific purposes identified in other legislation (e.g., Hospitals Act, , Regional

Health Authorities Act, Public Health Act); and

 • internal management including planning, resource allocation, policy development, quality
improvement, monitoring, audit, evaluation, reporting, obtaining or processing payment
for health services and human resource management.

Some custodians (the Minister and Department, and a regional health authority) may also
collect individually identifying health information that is directly related to and necessary for
the following purposes:

 • planning and allocating resources on a regional or provincial basis (e.g., provincial costing
project, development of alternate payment plans for physicians, conducting surveys about
health system performance);

 • managing the health system on a regional or provincial basis (e.g., supporting medical and

hospital reciprocal agreements, managing physical therapy and home care programs);

 • conducting public health surveillance to determine and improve the health of the regional

or provincial population (e.g., assessing environmental health hazards, identifying contacts
of individuals with communicable diseases); and

182

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER SIX – Collection of Health Information

 • developing health policies and programs on a regional or provincial basis (e.g., analyzing
utilization of programs and treatments to identify trends, developing programs for specific
target groups such as aboriginal groups, children, seniors, etc.) (section 27(2)).

See Chapter 7 of this Publication (Use of Health Information) for a more detailed discussion
of section 27 purposes.

See OIPC Investigation Report H2005-IR-002 (Collection is directly related to and necessary to
meet the duty imposed by the Cancer Programs Act to operate programs to detect, diagnose
and treat cancer.) http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/H2005_IR_002.pdf

See OIPC Investigation Report H2006-IR-001 (A Pharmacist’s practice of collecting the
prospective purchaser’s name, address, date of birth, phone and relevant information
pertaining to any allergies or medical conditions for sale of Insulin is authorized.)
http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/H2006_IR_001.pdf

BEST PRACTICE: Custodians should regularly review their collection of individually identifying
health information to ensure that the collection falls within section 20(a) or (b) and to eliminate
any unnecessary collections. If a custodian stops collecting certain individually identifying health
information, the collection instruments (forms, surveys, etc.), contracts and procedures requiring this
collection should be amended. Custodians should also ensure that information needed for subsets of
clients is collected only for those clients.

Administrative controls should be implemented to ensure that all new or modified collections of
individually identifying health information meet the criteria set out in section 20 and that the
minimum information needed to meet program needs is collected.

If irrelevant individually identifying health information is collected, it should be placed in a separate
file or electronic location to ensure that it is not improperly used and that it is destroyed at an
appropriate time after completion of the process for which the information was inadvertently
collected.

New collection activities and instruments should be reviewed by the Health Information Coordinator
or whoever carries out those duties and responsibilities.

 6.5

COLLECTING PERSONAL HEALTH NUMBERS

The inappropriate use of personal health numbers can have a negative impact on an
individual’s privacy. The personal health number provides a single point of access to that
individual’s identifying health information and is therefore, a single point of risk. The Health
Information Act intentionally limits the collection of personal health numbers by specifying
in section 21(1) who can require an individual to provide their personal health number. The
Act also gives individuals the right to refuse to provide their personal health number to any
person who is not referred to in that section (section 21(3)). Those other persons may ask an
individual for his or her personal health number but they do not have the right to require the
individual to provide it.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER SIX – Collection of Health Information

Other statutes, such as the Canada Health Act, ensure that individuals cannot be refused
necessary health services even if they cannot provide their personal health numbers.

This situation could arise where for example, an injured student is brought by a teacher to a
medical clinic for treatment and the parent has not previously provided the school with the
child’s personal health number.

 6.5.1

RIGHT TO REQUIRE PROVISION OF PERSONAL HEALTH NUMBER

Only custodians and persons authorized by the regulations have the right to require an
individual to provide the individual’s personal health number (section 21(1)).

Under section 5 of the Regulation, the following persons are authorized to require individuals
to provide their personal health numbers:

 • the Students’ Finance Board for the purpose of administering student health benefits

programs;

 • lawyers and insurers for the purpose of enforcing the Crown’s right of recovery under

Part 5 of the Hospitals Act;

 • insurers for the purpose of facilitating the handling, assessing and payment of claims for

benefits;

 • The Workers’ Compensation Board for the purpose of facilitating the handling, assessing

and payment of claims for benefits;

 • the Solicitor General for the purpose of providing health services to an inmate outside of a

correctional institution;

 • the Minister of Seniors and Community Supports for the purpose of administering the

Seniors Benefit Act and Alberta Aids to Daily Living Extended Health Benefits Regulation;

 • the Minister of Human Resources and Employment for the purpose of administering
the income and employment programs of the Department of Human Resources and
Employment;

 • persons, other than custodians, who provide health services to individuals for the purpose

of seeking reimbursement for providing those services from the Alberta Health Care
Insurance Plan.

“Insurer” is defined in section 5(1) of the Regulation as the ABC Benefits Corporation or an
insurer licensed under the Insurance Act.

Notice to Individual
Custodians and the persons listed in section 5 of the Regulation must advise individuals of
their authority to collect personal health numbers under section 21 before they request a
personal health number from an individual (section 21(2)).

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER SIX – Collection of Health Information

Right to Refuse to Provide Personal Health Number
Individuals can refuse to provide their personal health number if someone other than
custodians or those listed in the regulation asks for it (section 21(3)). However, they can
continue to provide their child’s number, if they wish, to babysitters or day care centers. School
jurisdictions, municipalities and post‑secondary institutions, subject to the FOIP Act, do not
have the authority under that legislation to collect the personal health number and are not
listed in section 5 of the Regulation as persons who may require the provision of the personal
health number.

 6.6

MANNER OF COLLECTION

The Act sets out the manner in which the collection of health information must take place.
This includes the duty of custodians to collect health information from the subject individual;
the exceptions to this duty; and the notice that must be given to the individual about
the collection.

 6.6.1  DUTY TO COLLECT DIRECTLY FROM INDIVIDUAL

Section 22(1) states that, subject to some limited exceptions, a custodian must collect
individually identifying health information directly from the individual who is the subject of
the information.

Direct collection is the primary method for obtaining individually identifying health
information. This helps to ensure that an individual is aware of the type of health information
being used, how it will be used and by whom. Even where a custodian may have the capability
to collect individually identifying health information from another source, it should not do so
unless indirect collection is authorized under section 22(2).

 6.6.2  AUTHORITY FOR INDIRECT COLLECTION

Section 22(2) of the Act provides for a number of circumstances where individually identifying
health information may be collected from a person other than the individual who is the subject
of the information collection.

BEST PRACTICE: When collecting information from someone other than the individual it is about,
especially a family member or relative, they should be informed that the individual has a right
to access any of their own health information subject to the exceptions in section 11. Under that
section, a custodian may refuse to disclose health information to an applicant if the disclosure could
reasonably lead to the identification of a person who provided health information to the custodian
explicitly or implicitly in confidence and in circumstances in which it was appropriate that the name
of the person who provided the information be kept confidential.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER SIX – Collection of Health Information

If disclosure of the information collected or identifying the source of the information to the individual
that it is about could place the informant or someone else at risk of serious harm, the informant
should advise the custodian and the custodian should take additional steps to protect the identity of
the informant.

Some steps that could be taken would be: avoiding identifying other sources in patient records (if this
is feasible); organizing documentation so that information from other sources is separate from the
patient’s information and easily identifiable; and if disclosure of an informant’s identity could cause
harm to that individual, document this on the patient’s file as well as why the information needs to
be kept confidential.

Some circumstances where indirect collection is authorized are:

 • Where the Individual Authorizes Collection from Someone Else (Section 22(2)(a))
Information may be provided by someone else orally, through written correspondence,
electronic information exchange or file transfer.

BEST PRACTICE: When an individual authorizes collection from another source, the authorization
should be in writing. This could be a signed authorization form or a letter giving authorization. If
the authorization is provided over the telephone, custodians should document the conversation
and, whenever possible, send a letter to the individual concerned setting out what he or she
has authorized.

When an individual is asked to authorize an indirect collection, the person should be informed
of the nature of the information to be collected, the purpose of the indirect collection and the
reasons for making the collection indirectly, and the consequences of refusing to authorize the
indirect collection.

 • Where the Information is Collected from the Individual’s Representative

(Section 22(2)(b))

If an individual who is the subject of the information is unable to provide the information, the
custodian can collect the information from a person referred to in section 104(1)(c) to (i) who
is acting on behalf of that individual.

Representatives can include a guardian of an individual under 18; a personal representative
of a deceased individual over age 18; a guardian or trustee appointed for an individual under
the Dependant Adults Act; an agent designated under the Personal Directives Act; an individual
who has been granted a power of attorney; or the nearest relative of a formal patient under the
Mental Health Act.

If an individual is being represented by a another person under section 104 (1)(c) to (i), it
may be necessary for a custodian to collect demographic information about the representative.
The principles of least amount of information and need to know will need to be applied in
this situation.

CHAPTER SIX – Collection of Health Information

 • Where Direct Collection Would Prejudice the Interests of the Individual, the Purposes of

Collection or the Safety of Another Individual (Section 22(2)(c))

A custodian may collect individually identifying health information indirectly where the
custodian believes, on reasonable grounds, that collection from the subject individual would
prejudice the interests of the individual; the purposes of collection; or the safety of any other
individual; or would result in the collection of inaccurate information.

Examples of this would be:

 • where a patient may not be honest with a custodian. Necessary, accurate information
about the patient’s health, effectiveness of medication may, therefore, not be obtained;
 • where a patient is likely to modify his or her behavior in such as way that it could prevent

an effective diagnosis or assessment of the patient’s treatment;

 • where an individual does not know the information that is needed (e.g., a senior dealing

with a pharmacist and neither the senior nor the pharmacist is aware of all the medications
the senior may be taking)

 • direct collection would delay the provision of emergency treatment;
 • requesting the information could cause the individual to react violently; or
 • in the case of a psychotic patient, another person’s perspective on symptoms and the effect

of a particular medication may be required.

“On reasonable grounds” means using logical, sensible or rational thought as the basis for
drawing a fair conclusion on a matter.

“Inaccurate information” refers to information that is wrong, incomplete or misleading or
information that does not reflect the truth.

 • Where Direct Collection is not Reasonably Practicable (Section 22(2)(d))

“Not reasonably practicable” refers to something that is not feasible or possible from a realistic
or practical standpoint.

Examples of situations where direct collection would not be reasonably practicable are:

•	 an	individual	is	unconscious;

•	 the	custodian	may	not	have	any	direct	contact	with	the	person;	or

•	 an	individual	is	not	capable	of	understanding	why	certain	information	needs	to	be	collected
or may be unwilling or unable to provide the information (e.g., admission of a patient to a
hospital under Part 1 of the Mental Health Act);

See OIPC Investigation Report H2002-IR-003 (Indirect collection is authorized as the Doctor
had a need to examine possible treatment options and the Complainant did not have
information and was not in position to obtain it because of recent admission to hospital.)

Context of Providing a Health Service to the Individual (Section 22(2)(e)(i))

A custodian may collect individually identifying health information about family members
or other relatives of an individual for the purpose of assembling a family or genetic history
where the information collected is to be used in the context of providing a health service to the
individual who is the subject of the information.

“Genetic history” refers to the gathering of the medical history of an individual’s ancestors to
determine whether there are any inherited physical or mental characteristics that may lead to
the development of a certain illness or medical condition in the individual.

The information can only be collected under the authority of this section in the context of
providing a health service to the individual it is about. It cannot be collected for research or
other purposes without the individual’s authorization.

 • Where Collection is for the Purpose of Determining the Individual’s Eligibility to

Participate in a Program or to Receive a Benefit (Section 22(2)(e)(ii))

This section provides authority for indirect collection where a custodian is determining the
eligibility of an individual to participate in a program or to receive a benefit, product or health
service from a custodian and the information is collected in the course of processing an
application made by or for the individual who is the subject of the information.

Certain programs of custodians may have eligibility criteria that must be met in order for an
individual to participate in them or receive a benefit or service. This may require the custodian
to approach several different sources of information besides the individual to determine
whether the criteria or qualifications are met.

Examples include determination of residency status for enrollment in the Alberta Health Care
Insurance Plan; determination of eligibility for receiving certain drug treatment programs; and
assessment of need for Home Care programs.

This collection can only take place in the course of processing an application from the
individual, or from his or her representative.

BEST PRACTICE: It is a good business practice to inform the individual about whom the information
is being collected that information from a variety of sources will be collected to document a
particular application. A statement of consent, signed by the individual can be included on the
application form but is not absolutely necessary.

 • Where Collection is for the Purpose of Verifying the Individual’s Eligibility to Participate

in a Program or to Receive a Benefit (Section 22(2)(e)(iii))

This section provides authority for a custodian to verify the eligibility of an individual who
is already participating in a program or receiving a benefit, product or health service from a
custodian to participate (or continue to participate) in the program or to receive (or continue to
receive) the benefit, product or service.

CHAPTER SIX – Collection of Health Information

This provision is intended to allow for cases where an individual has already qualified for
a program, benefit, product or service and the custodian needs to check or verify whether
the eligibility remains valid. In this case, individually identifying health information may be
collected from a variety of sources other than the individual the information is about and the
individual may not be informed that verification is taking place.

For example, random checks of sources of information on the income and assets of individuals
on social assistance may be made to determine whether an individual remains eligible for non-
payment of Alberta Health Care Insurance premiums.

BEST PRACTICE: It is a good business practice to inform the individual about whom the information
may be collected that verification of continuing eligibility may occur without notice. This is especially
necessary if the individual may incur any penalty for receiving a benefit for which he or she has
become ineligible.

 • Where Collection is for the Purpose of Informing the Public Trustee or the Public

Guardian about Clients or Potential Clients (Section 22(2)(e)(iv))

The Public Trustee is the trustee for dependent adults who are unable to administer their own
financial affairs because of a mental disability. The Public Trustee also administers the estates
of persons who die without a will if the deceased persons have no adult beneficiaries residing
in the province. This office also protects the assets and financial interests of missing persons
and children under 18 years of age.

The Public Guardian is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that appropriate surrogate
decision‑making mechanisms, supports and safeguards are available to assist adults who are
unable to make personal decisions independently.

This provision permits individually identifying health information to be collected indirectly
from relatives, friends and others about anyone who is or may become a ward of the Public
Trustee or Public Guardian. This may include information about the individual’s mental and
physical health.

 • Where use of the information is authorized by section 27(1)(d) (Section 22(2)(e.1))

Section 27(1)(d) provides that a custodian may use individually identifying health information
under its custody or control for the purpose of conducting research or performing data
matching or other services to facilitate another person’s research. A custodian may collect
individually identifying health information to use it for such purposes.

 • Where the custodian is conducting data matching for a purpose authorized under

section 27 (Section 22(2)(e.2)

Section 27 authorizes custodians to use individually identifying health information under its
custody or control for a variety of purposes. A custodian may collect individually identifying
health information to conduct data matching for such purposes.

CHAPTER SIX – Collection of Health Information

 • Where the Information is Available to the Public (Section 22(2)(f))

This section provides authority for a custodian to collect individually identifying health
information indirectly without the consent or knowledge of the individual where the
information has been published in any form or is a part of a record that is publicly available.

“Available to the public” refers to information that can be readily found in published or other
public sources.

“Published in any form” means in print form or in some other generally accessible form such
as an audiotape or videotapes.

Examples include birth, marriage or obituary notices, newspaper reports, clipping files and
articles in periodicals. Most of this information would be readily available in a public or
specialized library.

“Other public sources” refer to recorded information available for a fee or for free, such
as information that is available on the Internet, a written biographical sketch provided to
participants at a public function, or information in public registry records.

Information of a more private character, based upon personal acquaintance, friendship,
observation or gathered through surveillance, would not be included.

 • Where Disclosure is Authorized under Part 5 (Section 22(2)(g))

A custodian may collect individually identifying health information indirectly (e.g., from
another custodian) where the other custodian or other source has authority to disclose it under
Part 5 of the Act (Disclosure of Health Information).

Without this provision, a custodian might not have any authority to collect or receive
the information that is disclosed to it in an authorized way. The provision also assists in
eliminating the need for duplicate collection of the same information that has already been
disclosed to the custodian.

For example, an individual may have already consented to the disclosure of his or her
individually identifying diagnostic, treatment or care information to the custodian who needs
to collect this information; the disclosure is to a person authorized to conduct an audit of the
information, under certain conditions; or the disclosure is to a quality assurance committee
within the meaning of section 9 of the Alberta Evidence Act.

CHAPTER SIX – Collection of Health Information

 6.6.3  NOTIFYING THE INDIVIDUAL ABOUT THE COLLECTION

Section 22(3) states that when collecting individually identifying health information directly
from the individual it is about, the custodian must take reasonable steps to inform the
individual about:

 • the purpose for which the information is collected;
 • the specific legal authority for the collection; and
 • the title, business address and business telephone number of an affiliate of the custodian

who can answer the individual’s questions about the collection.

The requirement to provide notification applies only in those situations where information is
collected directly from an individual such as on an application, admission or intake form or on
a client survey.

“Purpose of collection” means the reason for which the information is needed and the use(s)
that the custodian will make of that information.

“Legal authority for collection” refers to the statute or regulation of Alberta or Canada that
expressly authorizes collection of the information, or section 20(b) which authorizes collection
of individually identifying health information if that information relates directly to and is
necessary to enable the custodian to carry out a purpose that is authorized under section 27.

Identifying someone to answer an individual’s questions about the collection is intended to
provide the individual with a knowledgeable source of information. The person or position
cited should be familiar with the program and be able to explain why the information is being
collected and how it will be used and retained by the custodian and how it may be disclosed to
other custodians or non‑custodians, if that is required or permitted.

The requirement to notify recognizes the individual’s right to know and understand the
purpose of the collection of individually identifying health information and how the
information will be used. It also allows the individual to make an informed decision as to
whether to give the information when there is no statutory requirement to do so.

The notice may be given by:

 • printing it on a collection form;
 • putting it on a separate sheet or in a brochure accompanying the form;
 • publishing it in an information brochure about a program;
 • displaying it on a notice hung on the wall or placed on a service counter; or
 • giving it verbally.

The same form of notice is required for computer‑generated forms, regardless of whether a
custodian or an affiliate enters the information about the individual or the individual does
the entry.

The notice must contain all three elements in section 22(3). It should be given to the individual
at the beginning of an interview or brought to an applicant’s attention before the applicant
begins to fill out an application form. If the interview is being recorded, it is good practice to
record the notice at the beginning of the tape.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER SIX – Collection of Health Information

When individuals are applying for and participating in extensive and complementary programs,
it may be more convenient and effective to place a generic notice in a publication about the
program or to explain this orally. In a physician’s office or at a community pharmacy, collection
notices could be posted on a wall or handed to a patient or client at the reception area
or counter.

However, it is important that the individual have an opportunity to make an informed decision
as to whether to give the information and understand any consequences that may result from
not doing so. This applies as well when information is collected over the telephone.

When notice is given verbally, either in person or over the telephone, the custodian should
ensure that the individual is informed of the privacy requirements in the Act. An explanatory
document can be provided either at the counter or later by mail. It is also a good practice to
provide written confirmation of telephone collection of personal information.

Where practicable, the custodian should provide an applicant with a copy of the notice and
retain a copy on file.

BEST PRACTICE: As part of the review of information practices and assessing compliance with the
provisions of the Act, custodians should regularly review their collection instruments (forms) to
determine which ones require collection notices.

Custodians should ensure that individuals are not misled as to the purpose of a collection and
that they have not been threatened or coerced during the collection process. If an individual is
uncomfortable with one way of collecting information, custodians should find another way of
collecting the information if that is possible. Individuals should not be asked intimate questions that
are not necessary for the purpose (e.g., treatment or diagnosis). Custodians should make an effort to
ensure that verbal collection is conducted in such a way that the information cannot be overheard
by other clients or patients.

 6.7

USING A RECORDING DEVICE

In certain cases, information about an individual may be collected by using a recording
device, camera or other device that may not be obvious to the individual. This could include
cases where a health services provider is observing an individual in a certain therapy or
treatment session.

Section 23 says that a custodian that collects health information from an individual using a
recording device or camera or any other device that may not be obvious to the individual must,
before collecting the information, obtain the written consent of the individual for the of the
device or camera.

Consent to use a recording device could be given by a representative of the individual under
section 104(1).

Use of Health Information

 7.1

OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER SEVEN

This chapter will cover:

 • the limits on the use of health information;
 • the duties of custodians using health information;
 • the use of non‑identifying health information;
 • the authority for custodians to use individually identifying health information;
 • the application of the ‘need to know’ principle to the use of health information

by affiliates;

 • the limits on the use of non‑recorded health information;
 • the use of personal health number by non‑custodians authorized by regulation.

 7.2

LIMITS ON THE USE OF HEALTH INFORMATION

The rules governing the use of health information are found in Part 4 of the Act (Use of Health
Information) (sections 25 to 30) and also within the duties of custodians relating to health
information in Part 6 of the Act (sections 57 and 58).

“Use” means applying health information for a purpose and includes reproducing the
information, but does not include disclosing the information (section 1(1)(w)).

A custodian may use individually identifying health information for such things as providing
health services; determining an individual’s eligibility for a program or benefit; providing for
health services provider education; carrying out an authorized purpose under an enactment of
Alberta or Canada; for internal management purposes and other specified uses (section 27(1)).

The concept of use also includes appropriate and controlled access to and sharing of health
information within a custodian. This means that if a custodian needs to carry out an
authorized purpose under section 27 by sharing individually identifying health information
within the scope of the custodian, this would be a “use” of the information, not a “disclosure”
under the Act.

Custodians are bound by the requirements of the Act whether the use of the information is
carried out by the custodian or by its affiliates.

CHAPTER SEVEN – Use of Health Information

There are a number of limitations on use of health information in the Act, particularly those
related to the use of individually identifying health information and also to the use of personal
health numbers. Individually identifying health information can only be used under the
conditions set out in the Act. However, these rules do not apply to the use of health information
that does not reveal the identity of individuals (non‑identifying health information).

A general prohibition on the use of health information is set out in section 25. That section
says that custodians must not use health information except in accordance with the Act.

Recipients of health information must not:

 • use the information for direct commercial marketing or fundraising purposes without

consent (section 107(2)(f));

 • take steps to re‑identify an individual from non‑identifying health information through

data matching without first notifying the Information and Privacy Commissioner
(section 32(2)); or

 • require an individual to provide their personal health number unless they have that

authority under section 21 or section 5(2) of the Health Information Regulation and must
not use the number for any additional purpose.

 7.2.1  DUTY TO USE HEALTH INFORMATION WITH THE HIGHEST DEGREE

OF ANONYMITY POSSIBLE

Custodians using health information must consider the level of anonymity that is needed for
the intended purpose. They must first consider whether the use of aggregate health information
will be adequate for the intended purpose and if so, must only use aggregate health
information (section 57(2)).

“Aggregate health information” is defined in section 57(1) to mean non‑identifying health
information about groups of individuals.

If the custodian believes that using aggregate health information will not be adequate for the
custodian’s intended purpose, the custodian must then consider whether use of other non‑
identifying health information is adequate for the intended purpose, and if so, the custodian
must use the other non‑identifying health information (section 57(3)).

“Non-identifying health information” is defined in section 1(1)(r) to mean that the identity
of the individual who is the subject of the information cannot be readily ascertained from
the information.

Under section 57(4), if the custodian believes that using aggregate and other non‑identifying
health information will not be adequate for the custodian’s intended purpose, the custodian
may use individually identifying health information if the use is:

 • authorized by the Health Information Act; and
 • carried out in accordance with the Health Information Act.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER SEVEN – Use of Health Information

Under section 65, a custodian may strip, encode or otherwise transform individually identifying
health information to create non‑identifying health information.

“Individually identifying health information” is defined in section 1(1)(p) to mean that the
identity of the individual who is the subject of the information can be readily ascertained from
the information.

“Readily ascertained” in the context of section 57, means that the identity of an individual
(e.g., the individual’s name or other identifiers or distinguishing characteristics associated with
an individual) can be determined or deduced without having to apply a sophisticated technical
method or process, or without having the particular technical expertise to do so.

An individual’s identity can be said to be “readily ascertained” if his or her identity can be
determined by:

 • combining available information within the same or in several different records;
 • comparing information representing distinguishing characteristics with other information

sources having both the distinguishing characteristics and the names or other identifiers of
individuals; and

 • if only readily available or conventional computer hardware, software and technical

expertise is used.

Section 57 does not apply where the use of health information is for the purpose of providing a
health service (as defined in section 1(1)(m)), or for determining the eligibility of an individual
to receive a health service.

See section 5.3.1 of Chapter 5 of this Publication for a more detailed discussion of this duty.

 7.2.2  DUTY TO USE HEALTH INFORMATION IN A LIMITED MANNER

In addition to complying with section 57, custodians must only use the amount of health
information that is essential to enable the custodian to carry out the intended purpose
(section 58(1)).

See section 5.2.2 of Chapter 5 of this Publication for a more detailed discussion of this duty.

 7.2.3  APPLYING THE ‘NEED TO KNOW’ PRINCIPLE TO THE USE OF

HEALTH INFORMATION BY AFFILIATES

Just as the Act limits the authority of affiliates to collect health information, it also limits the
authority of affiliates to use health information. Under section 28, an affiliate of a custodian
must not use health information in any manner that is not in accordance with the affiliate’s
duties to the custodian.

© 2006-2011  Government of Alberta
Health and Wellness

199

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER SEVEN – Use of Health Information

This means that unless the information is necessary for the affiliate to carry out one of its/
his/her designated responsibilities, the affiliate should not be using that information. This
also implies that custodians must identify the roles and responsibilities of their affiliates and
ensure that affiliates are informed about their duties and responsibilities. These roles and
responsibilities will limit the amount and the level of anonymity of health information they will
need to use.

In the context of a hospital setting, those affiliates who are directly involved with assessment,
diagnosis, treatment and care of an individual would need to use individually identifying
diagnostic, treatment and care information about the individual. They would also likely need
access to the most complete health information about the individual to ensure that all relevant
information is taken into account.

Other care providers such as pharmacy and dietary personnel may require certain individually
identifying information to carry out their duties and responsibilities but in most cases, would
not need access to the complete file for all patients.

In a multi‑unit facility, affiliates working in one unit are usually not involved in the care
of patients in another unit, unless they are covering off in the event of staff shortages or in
an emergency. Except in those cases, they would therefore not need to know or use health
information about the patients for whom they are not providing care or health services.

 7.2.4

LIMITS ON THE USE OF NON-RECORDED HEALTH INFORMATION

While the Act applies primarily to health information that is written or otherwise recorded and
stored, it also places a duty on custodians and their affiliates to protect the confidentiality of
information that is not recorded.

“Confidentiality” implies a trust relationship between the person supplying information and
the individual or organization collecting it. The relationship is built on the assurance that
the information will only be used by or disclosed to authorized persons or to others with the
individual’s permission.

Section 29 states that a custodian that collects diagnostic, treatment and care information (as
defined in section 1(1)(i)), or registration information (as defined in section 1(1)(u)) that is
not written, recorded or stored in some manner in a record may use the information only for
the purpose for which the information was provided to the custodian.

This means that if a custodian or its affiliates collect or become aware of the above types of
information related to an individual but the information is not recorded, it can still only be
used for the purpose for which it was collected.

CHAPTER SEVEN – Use of Health Information

 7.3

USING NON-IDENTIFYING HEALTH INFORMATION

Custodians may use non‑identifying health information for any purpose (section 26).

Practically speaking, health information is really only non‑identifying information if the
custodian or other person or entity receiving the information does not have other information
that could, in combination, identify an individual.

 7.4

AUTHORITY FOR CUSTODIANS TO USE INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFYING
HEALTH INFORMATION

Custodians who are health service providers rely on the controlled use of health information.
Their ability to use individually identifying health information is essential to the provision of
continuing care and treatment to an individual.

For example, specialists, nurses, other health professionals and home care workers need to
use health information about an individual collected from the individual’s family physician.
Pharmacists need to use information about an individual’s allergies and lab results as well as
other medications that the individual may be taking before filling their prescriptions or advising
them about over- the- counter medications.

Within a hospital setting, health service providers work together to provide the best
treatment and care to a patient, often using health information that has been collected by
another provider.

Custodians also need to use individually identifying health information for such things as
conducting investigations, discipline proceedings or practice reviews relating to a member
of a health profession or health discipline; providing for health services provider education;
conducting research under certain conditions; or for internal management purposes.

 7.4.1  AUTHORIZED PURPOSES

Section 27(1) sets out the situations in which an individual’s health information may be used
by a custodian. This section states that a custodian may use individually identifying health
information in its custody or under its control for certain authorized purposes.

The information in the custody or under the control of a custodian may have been collected
directly from the individual it is about or indirectly from other sources (with authority) or it
could have been compiled by the custodian (i.e., drawn from several sources with a new set of
information created).

CHAPTER SEVEN – Use of Health Information

The line between use and disclosure of health information is sometimes difficult to detect.
The movement of health information within the sphere of influence of a custodian , or to
an affiliate of that custodian (an employee, contractor, agent or volunteer) is a use of the
information. However, the movement of health information between custodians or outside the
sphere of influence of a custodian is a disclosure of the information.

See section 2.3 in Chapter 2 of this Publication for definitions of “custody” and “control”.

The authorized purposes are:

 • providing health services (section 27(1)(a));

Examples of this would be doctors, nurses and other health services providers reviewing an
individual’s chart or file so that they can make a diagnosis or provide a health service.
A “health service” is defined in section 1(1)(m), and the Regulation excludes certain
services from the definition.
See section 1.4.1 of Chapter 1 of this Publication for a more detailed discussion of what is
and is not included in a “health service”.

 • determining or verifying the eligibility of an individual to receive a health service

(section 27(1)(b));
This use would enable a custodian to check to see if a person is registered for Alberta
Health Care Insurance or other benefits or to assess whether an individual meets the
eligibility criteria.

 • conducting investigations, discipline proceedings, practice reviews or inspections relating

to the members of a health profession or health discipline (section 27(1)(c));

Under this provision, individually identifying health information could be used by
a custodian to investigate the actions or conduct of, or to initiate disciplinary action
against, an employee, contractor or agent who is a member of a health profession or
health discipline.

“Health profession” refers to the professions that are included in the Health Professions
Act (when proclaimed in force for the particular profession) e.g., physicians, nurses,
physiotherapists, psychologists, medical laboratory technologists, registered psychiatric
nurses, licensed practical nurses.

“Health discipline” refers to the professions or occupations that are included in the Health
Disciplines Act e.g., acupuncturists, respiratory therapists, midwives.

“Investigation” refers to a systematic process of examination, inquiry and observation.

“Discipline proceeding” refers to a formal process of determining whether a practitioner
has displayed a lack of skill or judgment in the practice of his or her profession; has
displayed unbecoming and/or unprofessional, disgraceful or dishonorable conduct; or is
incapable or unfit to practice his or her profession.

“Practice review” refers to an assessment or evaluation of the professional performance or
competence of a practitioner.

CHAPTER SEVEN – Use of Health Information

“Inspection” refers to the examination or viewing of the physical premises or of the books,
records, papers or other documents of a practitioner as part of an investigation.

 • conducting research or performing data matching or other services to facilitate another

person’s research:
–  if the custodian or researcher has submitted a proposal to a research ethics board in

accordance with section 49;

–  if the research ethics board is satisfied as to the matters referred to in section 50(1)(b);
–  if the custodian or researcher has complied with or undertaken to comply with the

conditions, if any, suggested by the research ethics board; and

–  where the research ethics board recommends that consents should be obtained from the
individuals who are the subjects of the health information to be used in the research, if
those consents have been obtained (section 27(1)(d));

Individually identifying health information may be used by a custodian, without an
individual’s consent, for conducting research or performing data matching or other
services to facilitate another person’s research only if this has first been approved by a
research ethics board and if the researcher complies with sections 49 and 50(1)(b) and any
conditions set by the ethics committee.

Individually identifying health information may be needed so researchers employed
by or under contract to a custodian can assess the outcomes of certain treatments or
benefit programs.

“Research” is defined in section 1(1)(v) as academic, applied or scientific health‑related
research that necessitates the use of individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care
information or individually identifying registration information, or both.

An “research ethics board (REB)” means a board designated by the regulations as a
research ethics board (section 1(1)(v.1). Section 2 of the Designation Regulation lists
the committees and boards that have been designated as research ethics boards for the
purposes of Division 3 of Part 5 (Disclosure for Research Purposes).

Examples are: University of Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board; and College of
Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta – Research Ethics Review Committee.

See section 8.15 of Chapter 8 of this Publication for more discussion of sections 49 – 56
dealing with Disclosure for Research Purposes.

 • providing for health services provider education (section 27(1)(e));

This provision enables a custodian to use individually identifying health information to
train health services providers and students through various levels of teaching and need to
know environments. This use must still respect the principle of highest level of anonymity
possible. It may not be necessary, for example, to use individually identifying health
information in a case study presented in a non‑clinical context.

CHAPTER SEVEN – Use of Health Information

For example students involved with care and treatment of specific patients on a hospital
unit would have access to individually identifiable health information for only those specific
patients. Students would not be provided access to health information about other patients on
that unit. For students within a classroom environment, practical treatment and care scenarios
would include anonymized individual/patient health information not individually identifiable
information.

“Health services provider” means an individual who provides health services
(section 1(1)(n)).

 • carrying out any purpose authorized by an enactment of Alberta or Canada

(section 27(1)(f));

An “enactment” could be a statute or a regulation under a statute. Other statutes that
authorize the use of individually identifying health information include the Regional
Health Authorities Act, the Hospitals Act, the Public Health Act and the Mental Health Act.

 • and for internal management purposes, including planning, resource allocation, policy

development, quality improvement, monitoring, audit, evaluation, reporting, obtaining or
processing payment for services and human resource management (section 27(1)(g)).

When custodians require non‑identifying information for these secondary, internal
management purposes, they may convert individually identifying health information
into non‑identifying form. The non‑identifying health information is usually sufficient
to achieve the intended purpose, although at times, individually identifying health
information may be required. It may be necessary, for example, for a custodian to verify
information, assess compliance, coordinate services to individuals or track services to
individuals across different jurisdictions.

Custodians may create non‑identifying information by grouping it (i.e., aggregating it) or
by stripping the identifiers to create individual anonymous information. If a custodian
intends to use non‑identifying health information, it may be necessary for the custodian to
retain identifiers for data‑matching processes. The custodian can strip the identifiers for the
final disclosure/use of the information once the data match has been made.

Section 27(1)(g) authorizes these kinds of uses of individually identifying health
information. Examples of uses for internal management are:

“planning” – projecting expected service demands to determine what resources will be
needed for the future (e.g., capital resources, human resources, equipment, supplies, etc.);

“resource allocation” –examining current service demand to allocate resources where they
can be best used (e.g., allocating human resources to different wards and shifts);

“policy development” – examining patient/population needs to determine what new
policies and programs may be required;

“quality improvement” – examining existing services and patient outcomes to determine
how services can be improved for the future;

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER SEVEN – Use of Health Information

“monitoring” – monitoring services provided to ensure that affiliates are accountable for
their activities and the resources they use;

“auditing” – auditing clinical records to ensure that record keeping by affiliates
meets legislated requirements. May also need to audit financial records for
accountability purposes;

“Audit” means a financial, clinical or other formal or systematic examination or review of a
program, activity or other matter under this Act (section 1(1)(c)).

“evaluation” – evaluating services to ensure they are being delivered appropriately
and efficiently;

“reporting, obtaining or processing payment for services” – billing funding sources for
services provided to patients (e.g., billing Alberta Health Care Insurance Plan, private
insurance plans, patients directly); and

“human resource management” – monitoring affiliates conduct and competence, including
reporting concerns about the conduct and competence of professionals to their respective
regulatory bodies. May also need to undertake workload measurements to determine what
human resources are required (mix and quantity).

Note: this use does not cover a custodian using patient files for the human resource
management of its staff who may also be its patients. This health information cannot be
used for selection, appraisal or termination of a member of a custodian’s staff.

 7.4.2  ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZED PURPOSES FOR CUSTODIANS WITH

HEALTH SYSTEM MANDATES

Section 27(2) authorizes certain custodians with health system management responsibilities to
use individually identifying health information for all of the purposes in 27(1) and also for four
additional purposes.

The custodians that may use individually identifying health information for these additional
health system purposes are:

 • a provincial health board (i.e., Health Quality Council of Alberta) established pursuant

to regulations made under section 17(1)(a) of the Regional Health Authorities Act
(section 1(1)(f)(iii));

 • a regional health authority established under the Regional Health Authorities Act

(section 1(1)(f)(iv));

 • the department (section 1(1)(f)(xii)); and
 • the Minister(section 1(1)(f)(xiii)).

These custodians are created, funded and held accountable for certain functions (including
those listed in section 27(2)) within their assigned mandate. In order to carry out these
functions, they may need to use individually identifying health information in certain limited
situations. In these cases, individually identifying information is often combined or aggregated
to develop anonymous information about groups of individuals.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER SEVEN – Use of Health Information

The main difference between health system purposes and internal management purposes is
that health system purposes often require information to be collected from several custodians
to undertake the purpose.

Non‑identifying health information is usually sufficient to achieve these purposes but at times,
individually identifying health information may be required. The general rules in the Act to
collect, use and disclose the least amount of information, at the highest degree of anonymity
apply to these custodians when undertaking health system purposes. While individually
identifying health information may be needed in the original data collection or manipulation
stages of the process, in most instances, the information could and should be aggregated and/
or anonymized prior to completing all of the process steps necessary to achieve the purpose.

These additional or secondary authorized purposes for the above custodians are:

 • planning and resource allocation (section 27(2)(a));

The Minister may use individually identifying health information for planning and resource
allocation at the provincial, regional and program levels. Health authorities may use this
type of health information for planning and resource allocation at the regional, program,
facility and unit levels.

For example, the provincial costing project calculates Alberta-based costs for various types
of health services for funding projections. Business cases are built for allocating resources
across different clinical programs. Future expenditures are forecast at the provincial or regional
program levels. Health authorities need to plan for the costs of providing certain treatments
such as dialysis or home intravenous treatments.

 • health system management (section 27(2)(b));

This enables the Minister to use individually identifying health information for this
purpose at the provincial, regional and program levels. It enables health authorities to use
it for health system management at the regional and program levels.

Examples are:

•	 analyzing	the	incidence	of	illness	or	contributing	factors	leading	to	an	illness	or	disease	to

introduce new health promotion or prevention programs;

•	 enabling	the	Minister	to	administer	the	third	party	liability	program	(tracking	costs	for
services provided to individuals and seeking reimbursement from the liable parties);

•	 coordinating	health	benefits	with	the	Workers’	Compensation	Board,	the	federal	health

programs (for RCMP, aboriginals), etc; and

•	 managing	drug	programs;	verifying	the	need	for	capital	construction	plans;	managing	health

programs (e.g., physical therapy, home care).

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER SEVEN – Use of Health Information

 • public health surveillance (section 27(2)(c));

This function includes the use of individually identifying health information for the
surveillance of infectious diseases and environmental hazards under the Public Health Act
and detecting cancer and other diseases.

Examples are:

•	 reporting	individual	cases	of	and	contact	tracing	for	communicable	diseases;

•	 assessing	environmental	health	hazards;

•	 screening	programs	to	identify	and	track	individuals	(for	breast	cancer	screening,	newborn
metabolic screening, cervical cancer screening, HIV and Hepatitis B prenatal screening); and

•	 immunization	programs.

 • health policy development (27)(2)(d);

Health policy development needs to be based on an accurate picture of current health
needs or health service delivery practices, but health policy decision makers would not
need to know the names and individual health details of each person in the affected
population. Individual identifiers should be removed as early as possible in the process.

Examples are:

•	 tracking	services	to	specific	individuals	so	services	can	be	coordinated	across	jurisdictions

(regions, government departments, provinces);

•	 developing	future	programs	for	specific	target	groups	(e.g.,	aboriginals,	children,	seniors,	etc.);

•	 developing	policy	from	utilization	analysis	of	programs	and	treatments;	and

•	developing	new	alternative	payment	plans	for	physicians.

 7.5

USE OF PERSONAL HEALTH NUMBER BY PERSONS AUTHORIZED
BY REGULATION

Section 30 states that a person who has the authority to require an individual to provide a
personal health number pursuant to section 21(1)(b) may use the information only for the
purpose for which the information was collected.

See section 5(2) of the Health Information Regulation for a list of the persons and organizations
that can require an individual to provide his or her personal health number.

The restriction on the use of personal health numbers is necessary because the PHN
creates a single point of access to a large amount of identifying health information about an
individual and therefore represents a single point of risk for unauthorized access or misuse of
this information.

See also section 6.5.1 in Chapter 6 of this Publication for a discussion on collection of
personal health numbers.

Disclosure of Health Information

 8.1

OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER EIGHT

This Chapter will cover:

 • the limits on disclosure of health information;
 • the duties of custodians and affiliates regarding the disclosure of health information;
 • the disclosure of non-identifying health information;
 • disclosure of individually identifying health information with consent;
 • disclosure of diagnostic, treatment and care information without consent;
 • notification of recipients of the purpose and authority for disclosure of diagnostic,

treatment and care information;

 • maintenance of information on disclosures of individually identifying diagnostic, treatment

and care information;

 • disclosure of registration information without consent;
 • disclosure of individually identifying health information without consent to archives;
 • disclosure of individually identifying health information to the Minister without consent;
 • disclosure of individually identifying health information by the Minister and Department;
 • disclosure to Minister or Department or to certain other custodians for health system

purposes; and

 • disclosure for research purposes.

 8.2

LIMITS ON DISCLOSURE OF HEALTH INFORMATION

The rules governing the disclosure of health information are found in Part 5 of the Act
(sections 31 to 56) and also within the duties of custodians relating to health information in
Part 6 of the Act (sections 57 and 58). These rules refer to the provision of health information
to someone other than the individual that it is about, usually to a third party. They attempt to
balance the protection of individual privacy with the disclosure of health information.

“Disclosure” refers to the release, transmittal, exposure, revealing, showing, providing copies
of, telling the contents of, or giving health information by any means to any person or
organization. It includes disclosure to another custodian or to a non-custodian. A custodian
making health information accessible to other custodians via the Alberta EHR does not
constitute a “disclosure” (section 56.3(7)).

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

It includes oral transmission by telephone, voice mail or in person; provision of the information
on paper, by facsimile or in another format; and electronic transmission through electronic
mail, data transfer or the Internet.

A general prohibition on the disclosure of health information is set out in section 31. That
section says that custodians must not disclose health information except in accordance with
the Act.

Custodians are bound by the requirements of the Act whether the disclosure of the information
is carried out by the custodian or by its affiliates.

Individually identifying health information can only be disclosed in accordance with the
rules set out in the Act. Those rules do not apply to the disclosure of non-identifying health
information. A custodian may disclose non-identifying health information for any purpose
(section 32(1)). However, if non-identifying health information is disclosed to a person who is
not a custodian, the custodian must inform the person that the Commissioner must be notified
if the person intends to use the information for data matching. “Data matching” is defined in
section 1(1)(g). The Commissioner must be notified of this intention prior to the data matching
being performed (section 32(2)).

See section 5.4 of Chapter 5 of this Publication for more discussion on data matching.

A custodian may disclose individually identifying health information to the individual
who is the subject of the information, to a representative of the individual (as defined in
section 104(1)(c) to (i) or, subject to the exceptions set out in sections 35 to 40, 46, 47 and 53,
to other persons with the individual’s consent.

Individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information may be disclosed by a
custodian without the consent of the individual that it is about for certain limited and specific
purposes stated in the Act, including disclosure to another custodian for any of the purposes
listed in section 27(1) and (2).

Individually identifying registration information may also be disclosed without the consent of
the individual it is about for certain limited and specific purposes stated in the Act.

There are also specific rules in the Act related to the disclosure of individually identifying
diagnostic, treatment and care information and individually identifying registration information
for research purposes

 8.2.1  DUTY TO DISCLOSE HEALTH INFORMATION WITH THE HIGHEST DEGREE

OF ANONYMITY POSSIBLE

Custodians disclosing health information must consider the level of anonymity that is needed
for the intended purpose. They must first consider whether the disclosure of aggregate health
information will be adequate for the intended purpose and if so, must only disclose aggregate
health information (section 57(2)).

“Aggregate health information” is defined in section 57(1) to mean non-identifying health
information about groups of individuals.

213

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

If the custodian believes that disclosing aggregate health information will not be adequate for
the custodian’s intended purpose, the custodian must then consider whether disclosure of
other non-identifying health information is adequate for the intended purpose, and if so, the
custodian must disclose the other non-identifying health information (section 57(3)).

“Non-identifying health information” is defined in section 1(1)(r) to mean that the identity
of the individual who is the subject of the information cannot be readily ascertained from
the information.

Under section 57(4), if the custodian believes that disclosing aggregate or other non-identifying
health information will not be adequate for the custodian’s intended purpose, the custodian
may disclose individually identifying health information if the disclosure is:

 • authorized by the Health Information Act; and
 • carried out in accordance with the Health Information Act.

Under section 65, a custodian may strip, encode or otherwise transform individually identifying
health information to create non-identifying health information.

(See section 5.3.1 of Chapter 5 of this Publication for a discussion of transforming health
information).

“Individually identifying health information” is defined in section 1(1)(p) to mean that the
identity of the individual who is the subject of the information can be readily ascertained from
the information.

“Readily ascertained” in the context of section 57, means that the identity of an individual
(e.g., the individual’s name or other identifiers or distinguishing characteristics associated with
an individual) can be determined or deduced without having to apply a sophisticated technical
method or process, or without having the particular technical expertise to do so.

An individual’s identity can be said to be “readily ascertained” if his or her identity can be
determined by:

 • combining available information within the same or in several different records;
 • comparing information representing distinguishing characteristics with other information

sources having both the distinguishing characteristics and the names or other identifiers of
individuals; and

 • if only readily available or conventional computer hardware, software and technical

expertise is used.

Section 57 does not apply where the disclosure of health information is for the purpose of
providing a health service (as defined in section 1(1)(m)), or for determining the eligibility of
an individual to receive a health service.

See section 5.2.1 of Chapter 5 of this Publication for a more detailed discussion of this duty.

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

 8.2.2  DUTY TO DISCLOSE HEALTH INFORMATION IN A LIMITED MANNER

In addition to complying with section 57, custodians must only disclose the amount of health
information that is essential to enable the custodian or the recipient of the information, as the
case may be, to carry out the intended purpose (section 58(1)).

Not all of the health information created and maintained by a custodian is relevant or
necessary to carry out a certain purpose or address a request for information. Even if
a custodian is required by the Health Information Act or another act to disclose health
information, it should be done by disclosing the least amount possible to achieve the
intended purpose.

For example, a physician would not release a patient’s complete file without knowing who the
information is being disclosed to, why it is needed and whether the same purpose could be
achieved by releasing less information. Even if the Act requires the disclosure of individually
identifying health information, the personal health number, date of service and a code
indicating the type of service might be sufficient.

Expressed Wishes of Individual
In deciding how much health information to disclose, a custodian must consider any expressed
wishes of the individual who is the subject of the information, together with any other factors
the custodian considers relevant (section 58(2)). If a patient asks a physician not to tell
family members about his or her medical condition, the physician would have to consider
whether it was necessary to override those expressed wishes. There are exceptions under
section 35(1) (n), refer to Chapter 8.5.15 of this Publication. This obligation to consider an
individual’s expressed wishes also applies when a custodian is deciding how much health
information to make accessible via the Alberta EHR (section 56.31).

See section 5.2.2 of Chapter 5 of this Publication for a more detailed discussion of this duty.

 8.2.3  APPLYING THE ‘NEED TO KNOW’ PRINCIPLE TO THE DISCLOSURE

OF HEALTH INFORMATION BY AFFILIATES

Just as the Health Information Act limits the authority of affiliates to collect and use health
information, it also limits the authority of affiliates to disclose health information. Under
section 43, an affiliate of a custodian must not disclose health information in any manner that
is not in accordance with the affiliate’s duties to the custodian.

This means that unless the disclosure of the information is necessary for the affiliate to carry
out one of its/his/her designated responsibilities, the information should not be disclosed by
that affiliate. This also implies that custodians must identify the roles and responsibilities of
their affiliates and ensure that affiliates are informed about their duties and responsibilities.
These roles and responsibilities will limit the amount and the level of anonymity of health
information that an affiliate will need to disclose.

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

In the context of a hospital setting, those affiliates who are directly involved with assessment,
diagnosis, treatment and care of an individual may need to disclose individually identifying
diagnostic, treatment and care information about the individual, e.g., to other custodians.

Pharmacy and dietary personnel might need to disclose information about the medications or
dietary restrictions of a patient moving from an acute care hospital to a long-term care facility
but would not need to disclose other individually identifying information that was not relevant
to their duties and responsibilities but which may have come to their attention as members of
the hospital treatment or care team.

 8.2.4

LIMITS ON THE DISCLOSURE OF NON-RECORDED HEALTH INFORMATION

While the Act applies primarily to health information that is written or otherwise recorded and
stored, it also places a duty on custodians and their affiliates to protect the confidentiality of
information that is not recorded. Early knowledge of various types of health information by
health professionals is often oral information (i.e., not written or recorded in any manner at the
time the information is collected).

“Confidentiality” implies a trust relationship between the person supplying information and
the individual or organization collecting it. The relationship is built on the assurance that
the information will only be used by or disclosed to authorized persons or to others with the
individual’s permission.

Section 44 states that a custodian who collects diagnostic, treatment and care information (as
defined in section 1(1)(i)), or registration information (as defined in section 1(1)(u)) that is
not written, recorded or stored in some manner in a record may disclose the information only
for the purpose for which the information was provided to the custodian.

This means that if a custodian or its affiliates collect or become aware of the above types of
information related to an individual but the information is not recorded, it can still only be
disclosed for the purpose for which it was collected.

For example, if the information that is being disclosed was provided to the custodian for the
purpose of disclosure to a home care nurse, and was not written or recorded, this information
may only be disclosed to the home care nurse.

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

 8.2.5  DUTY TO ENSURE AUTHORIZED RECIPIENT

Section 45 states that a custodian who discloses health information must make a reasonable
effort to ensure that the person to whom the disclosure is made is the person intended and
authorized to receive the information.

“Making a reasonable effort” in the context of this section would mean verifying and
authenticating the identity of any individual to whom health information is going to be
disclosed prior to the disclosure occurring. This ensures that individuals who request that
health information be disclosed to them are who they say they are.

The most common way of authenticating identity in the electronic world is through the use of
passwords. However, it could also include requiring proof of identity using tokens, biometrics,
challenge/response scenarios, digital signatures and certification authorities in more
sophisticated information systems or where the information being disclosed is particularly
sensitive. See section 5.2.4 in Chapter 5 of this Publication for the criteria for authentication
passwords.

In the non-electronic world, custodians should require proof of an individual’s identity,
particularly before disclosing individually identifying health information to him or her. That
proof could be in the form of photo identification (i.e., drivers licence, passport, etc.).

 8.3

DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFYING HEALTH INFORMATION
TO THE SUBJECT OF THE INFORMATION

A custodian may disclose individually identifying health information to the individual who
is the subject of the information or to a person referred to in section 104(1)(c) to (i) who is
acting on behalf of that individual (section 33).

If disclosure is made to the individual who is the subject of the information or to the
individual’s representative, custodians should ensure that they are disclosing the information
to persons who are authorized and intended to receive the information (section 45). See
section 8.2.5 above.

Individually identifying health information may be disclosed to a person representing or acting
on behalf of the individual who is the subject of the information. The persons who may act in
a representative capacity include:
 • the guardian of a minor;
 • the personal representative of a deceased individual if the deceased was 18 years of age

or older immediately before death and if the disclosure relates to the administration of the
individual’s estate;

 • a guardian or trustee appointed under the Adult Guardian and Trusteeship Act, if the

disclosure relates to the powers and duties of the guardian or trustee;

 • an agent designated under a personal directive under the Personal Directives Act, if the

directive authorizes the disclosure;

217

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

 • an attorney under a power of attorney if the disclosure relates to the powers and duties

conferred;

 • the nearest relative of a formal patient under the Mental Health Act if the disclosure is

necessary to carry out the obligations of the nearest relative under that Act; or

 • any person with written authorization from the individual.

NOTE: When an individual requests information about himself or herself and the information
is provided to the individual, it is not necessary to inform the individual of the purpose of the
disclosure. (section 42(2)(e)) See section 8.7 in Chapter 8 of this Publication for notification
of purpose of and authority for disclosure.

 8.4

DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFYING HEALTH INFORMATION
WITH CONSENT

The disclosure provisions in the Act begin with the concept that an individual should consent
to the disclosure of his or her own individually identifying health information. Subject to the
exceptions to this contained in sections 35 to 40, 46, 47 and 53, a custodian may disclose
individually identifying health information to a person other than the individual who is the
subject of the information, or the individual’s representative (section 104(1)) if the individual
has consented to the disclosure (section 34).

 8.4.1

REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSENT

For the purposes of section 34(1), consent must include:

 • an authorization for the custodian to disclose the health information specified in the

consent;

 • the purpose for which the health information may be disclosed;
 • the identity of the person to whom the health information may be disclosed;
 • an acknowledgement that the consenting individual has been made aware of the reasons

why the health information is needed and the risks and benefits to the individual of
consenting or refusing to consent to the disclosure;

 • the date the consent is effective and the date on which the consent expires; and
 • a statement that the consent may be revoked at any time by the individual providing it.

A consent or revocation of consent must be provided in writing or electronically (34(2)). Under
section 6(1) of the Health Information Regulation, an “electronic consent” means one that is
provided electronically. An “electronic consent or revocation of consent” (see section 8.4.3
following) means the granting or revoking of an authority that is provided electronically.

A disclosure of health information with consent must be carried out in accordance with the
terms of the consent (34(3)).

218

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

A consent that is provided in writing must be signed by the person providing it (34(5)).
A consent that is provided electronically is valid only if it complies with the requirements
set out in the regulations (34(6)). Under section 6(2) of the Health Information Regulation,
an electronic consent or revocation of consent is valid only if the level of authentication is
sufficient to identify the individual who is granting or revoking the consent.

Except for the provisions of the Act which authorize the disclosure of individually identifying
diagnostic, treatment and care information without consent (section 35, 37.1, 37.3), and
other individually identifying health information, registration information (sections 36 to 40),
the absence of consent is interpreted as the absence of authority. True consent is informed
and voluntary. Individuals cannot be penalized for refusing to consent to certain disclosures
through the denial of the provision of health services, particularly if that was the purpose for
which the information was originally collected.

Provision by an individual of his or her personal health number is not the same as consent for
disclosure of individually identifying health information.

 8.4.2  DISCLOSURE OF DIAGNOSTIC, TREATMENT AND CARE INFORMATION

FOR ORGAN DONATIONS AND TRANSPLANTS

The Human Tissue Gift Act was repealed and replaced by the Human Tissue and Organ
Donation Act. This new Act has recently been proclaimed. As there are several significant
differences between the old and new statutes, custodians may want to obtain legal opinion/
advice with respect to HIA issues around transplants and organ donations at this time. Note
that the definition of “diagnostic treatment and care information” includes Information
about the donation by an individual of a body part or bodily substance, including
information derived from the testing or examination of a body part or bodily
substance (section (1)(1)(i)(iii)).

 8.4.3

REQUIREMENTS FOR REVOCATION OF CONSENT

A “revocation of consent” means taking away the authority for the consent.

A revocation of consent must be provided in writing or electronically (section 34(4)). If the
revocation is provided in writing, it must be signed by the person providing it (section 34(5)).
A revocation of consent that is provided electronically is valid only if it complies with the
requirements set out in section 6(2) of the Health Information Regulation (section 34(6)).

 8.5

DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFYING DIAGNOSTIC, TREATMENT
AND CARE INFORMATION WITHOUT CONSENT

Section 1(1)(i) defines diagnostic, treatment and care information. In certain limited situations,
custodians may disclose individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information
without an individual’s consent. However, as “gatekeepers” of health information, they must
still disclose the least amount of information (section 58) with the highest degree of anonymity
(section 57(2)). They must also consider any expressed wishes of the individual who is the
subject of the information, together with any other relevant factors (section 58(2)).

Note that under sections 35(1)(c), (d), and (d.1) custodians may disclose individually
identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information for certain purposes but must consider
whether the disclosure would be contrary to the express request of the individual. Custodians
should have policies in place that will accommodate these express requests.

The following sections cover the only situations where custodians may disclose individually
identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information without the consent of the individual
who is the subject of the information.

 8.5.1  DISCLOSURE TO ANOTHER CUSTODIAN FOR AUTHORIZED PURPOSES

(Section 35(1)(a))

Disclosure of individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information to another
custodian without consent may be done for any of the purposes listed in section 27(1) or (2).
These are the same purposes for which a custodian may use individually identifying health
information in its custody or under its control.

The purposes include:

 • providing health services;
 • determining or verifying an individual’s eligibility to receive a health service;
 • conducting investigations, discipline proceedings, practice reviews or inspections relating

to the members of a health profession or health discipline;

 • conducting research (with the approval of a research ethics board);
 • providing for health services provider education;
 • carrying out any purpose authorized by an enactment of Alberta or Canada; and
 • for internal management purposes.

A regional health authority, Provincial Health Board, the Minister and the Department may also
disclose this information, within the geographic area in which they have jurisdiction, for the
additional purposes of:

 • planning and resource allocation;
 • health system management;
 • public health surveillance; and
 • health policy development.

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

See section 7.4 of Chapter 7 of this Publication for further information and examples of the
authorized purposes in section 27.

 8.5.2  DISCLOSURE TO ANOTHER GOVERNMENT FOR PAYMENT OF

HEALTH SERVICES (Section 35(1)(a.1))

This provision enables the disclosure of diagnostic, treatment and care information without the
individual’s consent to the government of another province or territory or to the government
of Canada. Disclosure is only permitted where the individual is a resident of the other province
or territory or where the government of Canada is responsible for payments for health services
provided to the individual. This disclosure provision simplifies the sharing of information to
determine funding accountability for health services. This further facilitates resource and policy
planning to improve health system management for the jurisdictions involved.

 8.5.3  DISCLOSURE TO A PERSON PROVIDING CONTINUING TREATMENT AND

CARE TO THE INDIVIDUAL (Section 35(1)(b))

This provision permits the disclosure of individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and
care information without the individual’s consent to the person (not limited to health care
providers) providing continuing treatment and care to the individual.

For example, if the individual is discharged from the hospital and returning home, disclosure
may be necessary to a family member or friend, so that appropriate care can be provided.

Investigation Report H2003-IR-001 authorized the Alberta Mental Health Board to disclose
individually identifying diagnostic treatment and care information to a school board for the
purpose of providing continuing treatment and care,

Under section 8(4) of the Health Information Regulation, if a custodian is disclosing health
information to a person in a jurisdiction outside Alberta, the custodian must enter into an
agreement with the person to whom the health information is being disclosed. This provision
does not apply to health information about an individual that is used in a jurisdiction outside
Alberta solely for the purpose of providing continuing treatment and care to the individual
(section 8(5) of the Health Information Regulation).

 8.5.4  DISCLOSURE TO FAMILY MEMBERS OR THOSE IN A CLOSE PERSONAL

RELATIONSHIP (Section 35(1)(c))

Under this provision, custodians may disclose information about an individual’s location,
presence, condition, diagnosis, progress and prognosis on that day to family members of the
individual or to another person with whom the individual is believed to have a close personal
relationship, without the individual’s consent. The disclosure must not be contrary to the
express request of the individual.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

“Person in a close personal relationship” could include a common-law spouse, a close friend
or other person who can demonstrate that he or she has such a relationship with the individual
who is the subject of the information.

This provision enables a custodian to discuss the diagnosis or condition of a patient or their
location with a patient’s relative or close friend.

BEST PRACTICE: If an adult patient in hospital has asked his physician not to disclose details of
his condition or prognosis to his spouse, then unless there was a requirement in law or a medical
emergency, the physician would respect that express request.

 8.5.5  DISCLOSURE TO FAMILY MEMBERS WHERE INDIVIDUAL IS INJURED, ILL

OR DECEASED (Section 35(1)(d))

Disclosure of individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information without the
individual’s consent under this provision is for the purpose of notifying or contacting family
members of an injured, ill or deceased individual or another person with whom the individual
is believed to have a close personal relationship or a friend of the individual. The disclosure
must not be contrary to the express request of the individual.

BEST PRACTICE: If an injured adult has specifically asked that his family not be contacted, the
hospital and physician should not try to contact family members since this would be contrary to the
patient’s express request.

 8.5.6  DISCLOSURE TO FAMILY MEMBERS WHERE INDIVIDUAL IS DECEASED

(Section 35(1)(d.1))

This provision enables the custodian to disclose individually identifying diagnostic, treatment
and care information relating to circumstances surrounding the death of the individual or
to health services recently received by the individual, to family members of the deceased
individual or another person with whom the individual is believed to have had a close
relationship without the individual’s consent. The disclosure must not be contrary to the
express request of the individual.

 8.5.7  DISCLOSURE TO AN OFFICIAL OF A PENAL OR OTHER CUSTODIAL

INSTITUTION (Section 35(1)(e))

This provision enables custodians to disclose diagnostic, treatment and care information that
identifies an individual without the individual’s consent to an official of a penal or other
custodial institution where the individual is being lawfully detained but only to allow health
services or continuing care and treatment to be provided to the individual.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

“Other custodial institution” could include a jail, holding cells, remand centre, juvenile
detention facility, or any other facility or institution where an individual is being lawfully
detained and cannot leave.

 8.5.8  DISCLOSURE TO A PERSON AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT

(Section 35(1)(f))

Disclosure of individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information without the
individual’s consent under this provision may be made to a person authorized to conduct an
audit if the person agrees in writing:

 • to destroy the information at the earliest opportunity after the audit is concluded, and
 • not to disclose the information to any other person except as required to accomplish the
audit or to report unlawful or improper conduct by the custodian or a health services
provider.

A “person authorized to conduct an audit” could be the Auditor General, another person
or body established by regulation for audit purposes or an employee or contractor retained
under contract to perform audit services. The authority to conduct the audit could be found
in a by-law or resolution of the custodian or may be a requirement under a statute, regulation
or policy.

“Audit” is defined in section 1(1)(c) to mean a financial, clinical or other formal or systematic
examination or review of a program, activity or other matter under the Act.

The conditions that the auditor must agree to before disclosure occurs are meant to ensure
that the information is not used for operational or administrative purposes, involving the
individuals concerned.

 8.5.9  DISCLOSURE TO A QUALITY ASSURANCE COMMITTEE (Section 35(1)(g))

This provision enables a custodian to disclose individually identifying diagnostic, treatment
and care information without the individual’s consent to a committee that has as its primary
purpose the carrying out of quality assurance activities within the meaning of section 9 of the
Alberta Evidence Act.

A “quality assurance committee” means a committee whose purpose is to study, assess
and evaluate the provision of health services with a view to continuous improvement of the
quality of health care or health services, or the level of skill, knowledge and competence of
health service providers. This term only applies to quality assurance committees as defined in
section 9 of the Alberta Evidence Act.

Any information disclosed to a quality assurance committee under this provision must not be
disclosed to any other person (section 35(2)) unless it is non-identifying health information
disclosed to another committee that has as its primary purpose the carrying out of quality
assurance activities within the meaning of section 9 of the Alberta Evidence Act (section 35(3)
of the Health Information Act).

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

In cases where several quality assurance committees are involved in reviewing the care
provided to a specific patient or group of patients, the committee that initially receives
the individually identifying information has a duty to transform the information into non-
identifying information. The exception to this is where the subject individuals consent to the
disclosure of their identifying information to the other committees.

 8.5.10  DISCLOSURE FOR THE PURPOSE OF A COURT OR QUASI-JUDICIAL

PROCEEDING (Section 35(1)(h))

A custodian may disclose individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information
without the individual’s consent for the purpose of a court proceeding or a proceeding before a
quasi-judicial body to which the custodian is a party.

This provision permits the disclosure of this type of health information to the legal
representatives of the custodian for use in such proceedings or to members of the quasi-judicial
body or court. The disclosure would normally be to, or through the legal representative of the
custodian. Such information may be disclosed to the legal representative of other parties to a
proceeding in accordance with the court disclosure and discovery rules that apply.

The following criteria, which are not exhaustive, may help in determining whether a body is a
“quasi-judicial body”.

The wording of these criteria is adapted from criteria in OIPC Order 99-025 which dealt with
what should be reviewed in determining whether a body is acting in a “judicial or quasi-
judicial capacity”.

 • Does the body need to conduct a hearing before a decision on the matter can be reached?
 • Does the decision or order directly or indirectly affect the rights and obligations of persons?
 • Is the adversarial process involved (are there two opposing parties)?
 • Does the body have to apply substantive rules to individual cases rather than implementing

social and economic policy in a broad sense?

The legislation under which a decision is made will have to be reviewed to see whether the
rules of natural justice apply. The nature of the issue to be decided and the importance of the
decision for those affected should also be examined.

Custodians who are not certain whether a proceeding they are involved with fits the
description of ‘quasi-judicial’ should seek a legal opinion.

 8.5.11  DISCLOSURE FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPLYING WITH A SUBPOENA,

WARRANT OR COURT ORDER (Section 35(1)(i))

This provision enables the disclosure of diagnostic, treatment and care information without
the individual’s consent for the purpose of complying with legal processes that require the
production of information. These processes include subpoenas, warrants or orders issued or
made by a court, person or body having jurisdiction in Alberta to compel the production of
information or with a rule of court that relates to the production of information.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

“Subpoena” is a command or summons requiring the attendance of someone as a witness at
a court or hearing. It will specify a place and time when testimony on a certain matter will
be required and may also order a person to meet the requirements of a court in Alberta to
disclose information.

“Warrant” is a judicial authorization to search for and collect something, which may include
individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information. The warrant will state in
writing what information, or what thing, its authority covers.

“Order” is an authoritative command, direction or instruction to produce something – in this
context, individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information.

The HIA was amended in 2006 to give explicit direction to custodians that they must not
disclose health information in response to foreign court orders without proper jurisdiction.
When considering responding to a foreign subpoena or other court order, custodians must take
reasonable steps to ensure it has been recognized by a court with jurisdiction in Alberta or
Canada, or obtain consent from the patient to disclose their health information. (Investigation
Report H2009-IR-002 prompts an important reminder to health information custodians - only
courts with jurisdiction in Alberta or Canada can compel the release of health information.)

Although section 35(1)(i) is stated in discretionary language, warrants or subpoenas have the
force of law. They should be reviewed carefully as to what specific information they cover.

Affiliates of custodians should consult with their legal advisor or the custodian when they
receive an order, warrant or subpoena in order to determine whether it provides sufficient
authority for the response that is being demanded. This means it must refer to information that
is actually in the custody or under the control of the custodian; it must have been granted by
a justice or person with proper authority and jurisdiction; and the instrument must have been
properly served; among other criteria.

BEST PRACTICE: If the police or any other person has a subpoena, warrant or court order, determine
whether the scope of the subpoena, warrant or court order actually includes the information
requested. For example, a warrant that provides authority for the police to arrest an individual
will usually not also compel the release of health information. Where a subpoena, warrant, or
court order is granted for the purpose of authorizing disclosure of certain health information, the
language of the subpoena, warrant or order will be clear as to that purpose.

Where it is determined that the scope of the warrant, subpoena or order includes disclosure of health
information, it must next be determined whether the warrant, subpoena or order was issued by a
court with jurisdiction in Alberta to compel production of the information.

If the subpoena, warrant or order provides authority for the custodian to disclose the information
requested to the police or other person, release the information on the basis of the subpoena,
warrant or order.

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

The following example illustrates a situation where a custodian may disclose under
section 35(1)(i).

BEST PRACTICE: Police request a list of underage teens admitted to hospital after overdosing on
‘ecstasy’ at an out-of-control rave. They want this information to interview the teens to try to identify
the supplier of the drug. The police present a search warrant that requires the hospital to release to
police the names of all individuals treated for ecstasy-related effects on the day of the rave and on
the following day. The warrant was issued by the Provincial Court of Alberta. After reviewing the
scope of the warrant and confirming that the warrant was issued by an Alberta court, the hospital
discloses the list of names to the police.

In any case where the scope of a warrant, subpoena, or order is unclear, or where the warrant,
subpoena, or order was granted by a court outside of Alberta, Custodians should consult with their
Health Information Coordinator or legal counsel.

 8.5.12  DISCLOSURE TO ANOTHER CUSTODIAN TO DETECT OR PREVENT FRAUD

OR ABUSE OF HEALTH SERVICES (Section 35(1)(k))

This provision authorizes a custodian to disclose individually identifying diagnostic, treatment
and care information to another custodian without the individual’s consent where the
disclosing custodian has a reasonable expectation that disclosure will detect or prevent fraud,
limit abuse in the use of health services or prevent the commission of an offence under an
enactment of Alberta or Canada.

A “reasonable expectation” has been described by the OIPC as one that would be deemed as
fair, proper, just, moderate, and suitable under the circumstances (Order 98-002).

An “offence” could include those under the Alberta Health Care Insurance Act, under the
regulated health professions statutes, other provincial statutes, or under the Criminal Code
(Canada).

An example of the use of discretionary disclosure under this provision would be a pharmacist
providing limited information to other pharmacists in a “fan out” about an individual trying to
use a suspicious prescription. See sections 37.1 for related provisions.

 8.5.13  DISCLOSURE TO AN OFFICER OF THE LEGISLATURE (Section 35(1)(l))

Under this section, individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information may be
disclosed without the individual’s consent to an officer of the Legislature if the information is
necessary for the performance of the officer’s duties.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

Examples of Officers of the Legislature are: the Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Chief
Electoral Officer, the Ethics Commissioner, and the Information and Privacy Commissioner.

Disclosure under this provision is restricted by the requirement that the information is
necessary for the performance of the officer’s duties.

For example, the Ombudsman may be investigating a complaint at the request of an individual
involving a decision made by the Department that relates to the individual’s health information.
Individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information may also need to be disclosed
to the Information and Privacy Commissioner for the purpose of a review of a privacy complaint.

If the reason for the disclosure is not clear from the request, custodians should seek an
explanation as to why the individually identifying health information is needed and whether
non-identifying information would be sufficient for the purpose.

 8.5.14  DISCLOSURE TO AVERT OR MINIMIZE IMMINENT DANGER TO HEALTH

OR SAFETY OF ANY PERSON (Section 35(1)(m))

This provision permits the disclosure of individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care
information without the individual’s consent to any person, including a municipal or provincial
police service if the custodian believes, on reasonable grounds, that the disclosure will avert or
minimize an imminent danger to the health or safety of any person.

Generally three criteria must be satisfied for “imminent danger” to exist:

 • clarity – the intended victim or group of victims must be ascertainable or sufficiently

identifiable;

 • danger – the danger to the victim must be serious bodily harm or death; and
 • imminence – the risk must be serious and a sense of urgency must be created by the threat
of danger. The risk could be a future risk but must be serious enough that a reasonable
person would believe that the harm would be carried out.

These three criteria must be considered in the context of each situation and in view of the
surrounding circumstances. There must be a clear and imminent threat of serious bodily harm
or death to an identifiable group or person that creates a sense of urgency.

BEST PRACTICE SCENARIO #1: The victim of a violent crime is being treated in a hospital, and the
custodian has become aware that the perpetrator of the crime is making realistic threats of further
harm to the victim upon discharge from the hospital. The custodian may feel that it is necessary
for the police to become involved in order to avert or minimize the potential of further serious
harm to the victim. For the police to start an investigation, the custodian will need to disclose some
individually identifying information about the victim. The custodian is authorized to make the
disclosure to police under section 35(1)(m).

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

BEST PRACTICE SCENARIO #2: An individual robbed a bank, carrying a briefcase that he claimed
contained an explosive device. He also claimed that he was dying of terminal cancer and had
“nothing to lose”. Several days after the robbery, police are requesting information from a local
cancer clinic about patients fitting the suspect’s description. The police do not have a warrant.

The custodian knows of two patients who match the suspect’s description. It is not obvious in this
situation, however, that there is an imminent danger to the health or safety of any particular person
or groups of people. The police may be able to provide additional information to the custodian. If the
custodian believes that there is no imminent danger, the custodian should exercise discretion not to
disclose to the police any health information.

The key element is whether the custodian believes, on reasonable grounds, that imminent danger to
the health or safety of any person will be minimized or averted by this disclosure.

Were the situation different and the custodian had a reasonable belief that the suspect presents a
danger to the health and safety of the community, but the danger is not necessarily imminent, the
custodian could consider whether section 37.3 would apply. See section 8.9 of this Publication for
further information on such disclosures.

 8.5.15  DISCLOSURE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO LACKS

THE MENTAL CAPACITY TO PROVIDE CONSENT (Section 35(1)(n))

Under this provision, a custodian may disclose individually identifying diagnostic, treatment
and care information if the individual lacks the mental capacity to consent, does not have a
representative or substitute decision – maker under section 104(1)(c) to (i) and, in the opinion
of the custodian, the disclosure is in the best interests of the individual.

Before disclosure of health information occurs under this provision, the custodian is required to
form an opinion about two things:

 • whether the individual lacks the mental capacity to provide a voluntary and informed

consent; and

 • whether the disclosure would be in the best interests of the individual.

Both opinions would be based upon the custodian’s judgment (if the custodian is a physician
or other clinician) or upon the judgment of an affiliate of the custodian who could provide
the custodian with an expert opinion about both the mental capacity and best interests of the
individual. Whether or not disclosure should occur would also depend upon the circumstances
of each individual situation. The custodian can only disclose the minimum amount of
information required to carry out the purpose.

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

 8.5.16  DISCLOSURE TO A DESCENDANT OF A DECEASED INDIVIDUAL,

AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR A PERSON PROVIDING
HEALTH SERVICES TO A DESCENDANT (Section 35(1)(o))

This provision allows a custodian to disclose individually identifying diagnostic, treatment
and care information to a descendant of a deceased individual, a person referred to in
section 104(1)(c) to (i) who is acting on the behalf of the descendant or a person who is
providing health services to the descendant.

However, before disclosure is made, the custodian must first form an opinion that:
 • the disclosure is necessary to provide health services to the descendant; and
 • the disclosure is restricted sufficiently to protect the privacy of the deceased individual.

Examples of persons referred to in section 104(1)(c) to (i) would be a parent or guardian of
a descendant who is under 18 years of age and does not meet the criterion in 104(1)(b), a
guardian or trustee under the Adult Guardian and Trusteeship Act, the nearest relative of a formal
patient under the Mental Health Act, an individual authorized by a power of attorney, etc.

The disclosure must be necessary to provide health services to the descendant as “health
services” is defined in section 1(1)(m). The custodian must also restrict the disclosure to
protect the privacy of the deceased individual. This would mean limiting the amount of
information disclosed to what was absolutely necessary for the provision of health services to
the descendant (not the complete medical record of the deceased).

Custodians who are also public bodies under the FOIP Act should note that the Health
Information Act does not have a provision similar to section 16(2)(i) of the FOIP Act which
says that it would not be an unreasonable invasion of a deceased’s personal privacy to disclose
personal information about an individual who has been dead for 25 years or more.

 8.5.17  DISCLOSURE AUTHORIZED OR REQUIRED BY AN ENACTMENT OF

ALBERTA OR CANADA (Section 35(1)(p))

This provision permits a custodian to disclose individually identifying diagnostic, treatment
and care information without the individual’s consent if another enactment of Alberta or
Canada authorizes or requires the disclosure.

“Enactment” means an act or regulation or any portion of an act or regulation. A “regulation”
means a regulation, order, rule, form, tariff of costs or fees, proclamation, bylaw or resolution
enacted in the execution of a power conferred by or under the authority of an Act, or by or
under the authority of Cabinet. A regulation does not include an order of a court made in the
course of an action or an order made by a public officer or administrative tribunal is a dispute
between 2 or more persons. The act or regulation must either be an Alberta or federal statute
or regulation (not another province’s legislation) and must impose an obligation to disclose the
health information or, alternatively, authorize or permit the disclosure.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

Since disclosures under this provision are discretionary, unless another enactment expressly
prevails over the Health Information Act, custodians must still exercise their discretion in terms
of disclosures of health information that are authorized or required by another enactment.

(See Chapter 12 of this Publication on Consequential Amendments which discusses some of
the statutory provisions that prevail over the Health Information Act).

Some examples of other statutes that authorize or require, in particular situations, the
disclosure of certain types of individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care
information are:

 • Criminal Code (Canada) provides authority to compel disclosure of information by way

of warrants or subpoenas specifying the health information requested. Also authorizes the
release of information to a board of review appointed under the Criminal Code;
 • Controlled Drugs and Substances Act authorizes the issuance of search warrants for

peace officers to search for and to seize controlled substances. Under the Narcotic Control
Regulations, certain health service providers must allow the Minister of Justice to have
access to records, and are required to report any loss or theft of a narcotic within 10 days to
the Minister.

 • Fatality Inquiries Act requires custodians to report certain kinds of deaths and disclose

certain information to medical examiner’s investigators.

 • Protection for Persons in Care Act establishes a duty to report cases of possible abuse of an

adult in care.

 • Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act establishes a duty to report cases of children in

need of intervention services.

 • The Mental Health Act has recently been amended to specifically authorize the disclosure

of health information in certain circumstances to a family physician (e.g., discharge
information).

 • Public Health Act provides for the disclosure of information about recalcitrant patients

and also requires custodians to notify the Medical Officer of Health in cases of specified
communicable diseases.

 • Vital Statistics Act requires births and deaths to be reported to the Director of

Vital Statistics.

 • Gunshot and Stab Wounds Mandatory Disclosures Act requires custodians to disclose

certain health information of gunshot and stab wound victims to police.

 8.5.18  DISCLOSURE TO THE SUCCESSOR OF A CUSTODIAN (Section 35(1)(q))

Under this provision, a custodian may disclose individually identifying diagnostic, treatment
and care information without the individual’s consent to its successor if:

 • the successor is a custodian; and
 • it is for the purpose of the custodian transferring its records to the successor as a result of
the custodian ceasing to be a custodian or ceasing to provide health services within the
geographic area in which the successor provides health services.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

A “successor” would be the person or organization that obtains ownership of or title to a
custodian’s facility or practice when the custodian ceases to be a custodian. A successor
could be an individual, a partnership, corporation or other unincorporated organization or
sole proprietorship.

This provision would, for example, enable a physician or other health professional in the
publicly funded health system to transfer his or her patient files to another physician who is
taking over the practice of that physician.

 8.5.19  DISCLOSURE TO A THIRD PARTY INSURER (Section 35(1)(r))

Under this provision a custodian may disclose individually identifying diagnostic, treatment
and care information without the individual’s consent to a third party insurer who is
responsible for the payment of that individual’s health product or service claim.

For example this will enable adjudication of prescriptions and also facilitate insurance claims
regarding dental plans, drug plans, and coverage for chiropractors and physiotherapists.

 8.5.20  DISCLOSURE TO ADMINISTER THE TRIPLICATE PRESCRIPTION PROGRAM

(Section 35(1)(s))

This provision enables the disclosure of individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and
care information without individual consent to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of
Alberta (CPSA) for the purpose of administering the Triplicate Prescription Program (TPP). The
TPP monitors the prescribing and use of certain drugs that entail a greater than average risk
of misuse.

 8.5.21  DISCLOSURE TO A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL BODY (Sections 35(4) and 35(5))

Section 35(4) authorizes a custodian to disclose individually identifying diagnostic, treatment
and care information without the individual’s consent to a health professional body for the
purpose of an investigation, a discipline proceeding, a practice review or an inspection, where:

 • the custodian has complied with any other enactment authorizing or requiring the

custodian to disclose that information for that purpose (e.g., the Health Professions Act);
and

 • the health professional body agrees in writing not to disclose the information to any other
person except as authorized by or under the Act governing the health professional body.

A “health professional body” is defined in section 1(1)(l) as a body that regulates the members
of a health profession or health discipline pursuant to an Act. Examples of these bodies are the
College & Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta, Alberta College of Optometry, Alberta
College of Pharmacists, Alberta Dental Association and College, College of Physicians and
Surgeons of Alberta and the College of Physical Therapists of Alberta, among others.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

An “investigation” refers to a systematic process of examination, inquiry and observation.

A “discipline proceeding” refers to a formal process of determining whether a practitioner
has displayed a lack of skill or judgment in the practice of his or her profession; has displayed
unbecoming and/or unprofessional, disgraceful or dishonorable conduct; or is incapable or
unfit to practice his or her profession.

A “practice review” refers to an assessment or evaluation of the professional performance or
competence of a practitioner.

An “inspection” refers to the examination or viewing of the physical premises or of the books,
records, papers or other documents of a practitioner as part of an investigation.

The health professional body must agree in writing not to disclose the information except as
authorized under the Act governing that health professional body.

In addition section 35(5) authorizes a custodian to disclose individually identifying diagnostic,
treatment and care information to a health professional body for the purpose of lodging a
complaint with the health professional body.

 8.6

MAINTENANCE OF INFORMATION ON DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUALLY
IDENTIFYING DIAGNOSTIC, TREATMENT AND CARE INFORMATION (Section 41)

This provision says that when a custodian discloses a record containing individually identifying
diagnostic, treatment and care information without consent under section 35(1) or (4), the
custodian must make a notation of that disclosure.

The provision only applies to disclosure of a “record” as that is defined in section 1(1)(t) not to
disclosure of health information that is not in a record.

For example, a telephone call by a pharmacist to a physician regarding a patient’s prescription
or a verbal consultation about a patient between a family physician and a specialist would not
have to be noted under this provision.

The disclosure notation requirement applies to any disclosure of a record containing
individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information without the individual’s
consent. This would include disclosure of individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and
care information to another custodian for an authorized purpose under section 27.

The notation must include:

 • the name or number that identifies the custodian to whom the information is disclosed;
 • the date and time that the information is disclosed; and
 • a description of the information disclosed.

232

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

This requirement is not applicable when a custodian allows other custodians electronic
access to individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information stored in a
database, provided that, when the information is disclosed, the database automatically keeps
an electronic log of a name or number that identifies the custodian to whom the information
is disclosed, the date and time that the information is disclosed and a description of the
information that is disclosed (section 41(1.1.))

Notations of disclosure information must be retained by the custodian for 10 years following
the date of disclosure (section 41(2)). This enables an individual who is the subject of the
information to ask the custodian for access to and a copy of the information. The provisions
in Part 2 of the Act (Individual’s Right to Access Individual’s Health Information) regarding
the access request process would apply to this type of request. The request for the disclosure
notation information might be a separate request under section 7(1) or the records might
be included as part of a request for all of an individual’s own health information under
that section.

Disclosure notations could take a number of forms. They could be in either paper or electronic
form but need to be retrievable by individual identifier. The notation could be made on an
individual’s health record or file in a practitioner’s office or on a client’s electronic drug
record in a pharmacy. If the notation is not made on the individual’s file or health record, a
“disclosure log” or book could be used to record all disclosures where a notation is required
under section 41. Alternatively, the notation could take the form of a transmittal memo that is
then put into a log or onto the individual’s health record or file.

For health authorities and larger clinics, disclosure notations are likely to be made by health
records’ personnel on the patient’s individual chart, file or record and would be accessible to
the patient if they made an access request under Part 2 of the Act.

An alphabetical log is preferable to a chronological log so that an individual could access
this information about him/herself but care would have to be taken to ensure that disclosure
information about other individuals was not disclosed to the applicant.

The maintenance of notations of disclosure is necessary to enable a custodian to comply with
its duties under sections 13 and 14 in response to a request for correction or amendment of
health information. Under section 13, if a correction or amendment has been made, a notice of
the correction or amendment must be provided to any person to whom the health information
that is the subject of the applicant’s request has been disclosed in the preceding year.

Under section 14, if a correction or amendment is refused and the individual submits a
statement of disagreement, the custodian must provide the statement of disagreement
to any person to whom the custodian has disclosed the record in the year preceding the
applicant’s request.

 8.7

NOTIFICATION OF RECIPIENT OF PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY FOR DISCLOSURE
OF DIAGNOSTIC, TREATMENT AND CARE INFORMATION (Section 42)

A custodian that discloses individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information
must inform the recipient in writing of the purpose of the disclosure and the authority under
which the disclosure is made (section 42(1)). Section 42(2) says that this provision does not
apply where the disclosure is:

 • to another custodian under section 35(1)(a) (for authorized purposes under section 27 –

e.g., providing health services or managing the health system);

 • to the Minister or the Department under section 46;
 • to certain other custodians under section 47;
 • to a police service or the Minister of Justice and Attorney General under sections 37.1 or

37.3; or

 • to the individual whom the information is about.
 • Recipients of health information must not:
 • use the information for direct commercial marketing or fundraising purposes without

consent (section 107(2)(f));

 • take steps to re-identify an individual from non-identifying health information through data
matching without first notifying the Information and Privacy Commissioner (section 32(2);
or

 • require an individual to provide their personal health number unless they have that
authority under section 21 of the Health Information Regulation and cannot use the
number for any additional purpose.

For the various forms of Notices to Recipients, see Appendix 1 of this Publication.

 8.8

DISCLOSURE OF REGISTRATION INFORMATION WITHOUT CONSENT
(Section 36)

Under this provision, a custodian may disclose individually identifying registration information
without the individual’s consent for the following purposes:

 • for any purposes for which diagnostic, treatment and care information may be disclosed
under section 35(1) or (4) (see section 8.5 of this Chapter for the types of recipients);

 • to any person for the purpose of collecting or processing a fine or debt owing by the

individual to the Government of Alberta or to a custodian (section 36(b)); or

 • to a person who is not a custodian if the disclosure is in accordance with the requirements

set out in the regulations. (section 36(c)).

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

“Registration information” is defined in section 1(1)(u) as information relating to an individual
that falls within the following general categories and is more specifically described in the
Health Information Regulation:

 • demographic information (such as name, photograph, gender, personal health number,

date of birth, etc.);

 • location, residency and telecommunications information (such as home mailing address,
electronic address, citizenship and immigration status, date of entry into Canada and into
Alberta, etc.);

 • health service eligibility information, such as whether the individual is registered as a

registrant or dependant under the Health Insurance Premiums Act, whether the individual
is exempt from the requirement to register or pay premiums under that Act, etc.);

 • billing information (such as information about amounts owed by the individual to the

custodian, method of payment, the individual’s account number, etc.).

but does not include information that is not written, photographed, recorded or stored in some
manner in a record.

For the purposes of section 1(1)(u), section 3 of the Health Information Regulation lists the
information relating to an individual that is included in the term “registration information”.

An individual’s account number has been included in registration information to ensure
that the collection, use and disclosure of these numbers can be regulated. Custodians
have a duty to protect account numbers. Custodians may be fined if account numbers are
inappropriately disclosed.

BEST PRACTICE: Custodians should not disclose individuals’ account numbers except with consent.

For the purposes of section 36(c), a custodian may disclose to an ambulance attendant or
operator under the Ambulance Services Act individually identifying registration information
about an individual without the consent of the individual (section 7 of the Health
Information Regulation).

Custodians need to be very cautious in disclosing registration information even if it is just a
name and address. If the disclosure of registration information could reasonably be expected
to result in harm to the individual’s mental or physical health or safety, the custodian
should first obtain the individual’s consent or transform the information so that it becomes
non-identifying information.

DISCLOSURE TO PREVENT OR LIMIT FRAUD OR ABUSE OF HEALTH SERVICES
(Section 37.1)

This provision authorizes a custodian to disclose limited individually identifying diagnostic,
treatment and care information to the police or the Minister of Justice and Attorney General,
without the individual’s consent. When the custodian “reasonably believes” that the
information disclosed:

 • relates to the possible commission of an offence under a statute of Alberta or Canada
and
 • will also detect, limit or prevent fraud or abuse in the use of health services.

“Reasonably believes” means having a view that is supported by logic and knowledge of the
relevant circumstances.

The “possible commission” of an offence includes offences that are known to have occurred,
or are ongoing, or could possibly occur in the future.

An “offence” could include those under the Alberta Health Care Insurance Act, under various
statutes of regulated health professionals, other provincial statutes, or under the Criminal Code
(Canada).

For individuals suspected of fraudulent use or abuse of the health system, the individually
identifiable information that may be disclosed is:

 • the individual’s name;
 • the individual’s date of birth;
 • the individual’s personal health number;
 • the nature of any injury or illness of the individual;
 • the date on which a health service was sought or received;
 • the location where the health service was sought or received;
 • the name of any drug provided or prescribed to the individual, and the date the drug was

provided or prescribed;

 • information specified in section 1(1)(i)(ii) about a health services provider who provided a

health service to an individual.

The custodian has discretionary authority to disclose all or some of these data elements, as
appropriate for the circumstances.

When making this type of disclosure, the section 42 requirement to inform the recipient in
writing of the purpose and authority for disclosure does not apply.

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

For example, an individual presents to a rural hospital providing identification and PHN of
another individual. The front desk administrator recognizes that the identification is fraudulent
as it belongs to another individual known to hospital staff. The administrator may want to
contact police to report a possible commission of an offence. In this case the disclosure of
limited information would prevent abuse of health services.

An individual presents to a pharmacy with a prescription that appears to have been altered.
After verifying with the physician that the prescribed quantity is 10 tablets, not 100, the
pharmacist may contact the police if he or she reasonably believes this individual is trying
to fraudulently obtain medication. The disclosure would prevent fraud and abuse of health
services by enabling police to investigate.

 8.9.1  DISCLOSURE TO PREVENT OR LIMIT FRAUD OR ABUSE OF HEALTH SERVICES

BY HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDERS (Health Care Insurance Act, Section 39.1)

This provision contained within the Health Care Insurance Act authorizes a custodian to
disclose limited individually identifying provider information to the police or the Minister of
Justice and Attorney General without the health services provider’s consent. The custodian
must “reasonably believe” or suspect, with reason, that the information to be disclosed:

 • relates to the possible commission of an offence under a statute of Alberta or Canada
and
 • will also detect or prevent fraud or limit abuse in the provision of health services.

The custodian may disclose the following information:

 • the name and business address of the person who provided the health service;
 • the name and address of the person who received the health service;
 • the date on which the health service was provided;
 • the description of the health service provided; and
 • the benefits that were paid or charged in relation to the health services provided.

 8.9.2  DISCLOSURE TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY (Section 37.3)

This provision grants to custodians the discretionary authority to disclose individually
identifying health information, without the individual’s consent, to the police or the Minister of
Justice and Attorney General where the custodian reasonably believes:

 • the information relates to a possible commission of an offence under a statute of Alberta or

Canada

and
 • the disclosure will protect the health and safety of Albertans.

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

Under this provision the health information the custodian may disclose is:

 • an individual’s name;
 • an individual’s date of birth;
 • the nature of any injury or illness of an individual;
 • the date on which a health service was sought or received by an individual;
 • the location where an individual sought or received a health service;
 • whether any samples of bodily substances were taken from an individual (NOT the sample

itself or its results)

 • information specified in section 1(1)(i)(ii) about a health services provider who provided a

health service to an individual.

The custodian is authorized to disclose all of these data elements, however, only those
appropriate for the circumstances should be disclosed.

When making this type of disclosure, the section 42 requirement to inform the recipient in
writing of the purpose and authority for disclosure does not apply.

Example

An oncology clinic nurse is watching news on television at home when he learns of an armed
robbery at a local bank. A man reportedly approached a teller for cash, revealing a gun and
stating that he was dying and had ‘nothing to lose’. Shots were fired although no one was
injured. Footage from the bank’s surveillance equipment was shown and the police asked the
general public for assistance identifying the robber.

The nurse believes that the robber is a patient he recently treated at the oncology clinic. The
next day, the nurse seeks advice from his manager. Together they determine that the nurse
should contact the police and disclose the identity of the individual. The key factors to the
decision are that (1) the nurse reasonably believes that the information relates to an offence
(the bank robbery) and (2) that disclosure would enable the police to further investigate the
crime – the nurse fears that if he does not disclose the patient’s identity to the police, the
patient will engage in further violent crime and endanger other members of the community.
The nurse and the manager are not required to inform the patient of a disclosure made under
section 37.3 and do not plan to do so.

 8.9.3  DISCLOSURE TO POLICE BY AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS

(Emergency Health Services Act)

Ambulance attendants as defined in the Emergency Health Services Act have additional
latitude to disclose individually identifying health information to police. The Emergency Health
Services Act (Section 40.1) enables ambulance attendants, when attending the scene of an
incident, to disclose to police:

 • the name of a patient or other individual;
 • the date of birth of a patient;
 • information about the nature of any injury or illness of a patient, including any observation

of possible impairment;

 • the time and date that the ambulance attendant was dispatched to and attended the scene

of an incident;

 • the location where a patient sought or received an emergency health service;
 • observations regarding the scene of an incident;
 • if any disruption of the scene of an incident was observed or was caused by the ambulance

attendant, a description of the disruption, including whether any patient was moved,
whether specialized equipment was used and whether any materials found at the scene of
the incident were disturbed;

 • whether any samples of bodily substances were taken from a patient;
 • the transport destination of any patient removed from the scene of an incident;
 • any other information that is prescribed or otherwise described in the regulations.

 8.10

DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFYING HEALTH INFORMATION
WITHOUT CONSENT TO AN ARCHIVE (Section 38)

This provision permits a custodian to disclose individually identifying health information
without the individual’s consent to the Provincial Archives of Alberta or to any other archives
that are subject to the Health Information Act or to the FOIP Act for the purposes of permanent
preservation and historical research if, in the opinion of the custodian, the information has
enduring value.

An “archives” could be the custodian’s own archives, in which case the health records would
remain in the custody or under the control of the custodian. It could be the archives of another
custodian or public body under the FOIP Act in which case, custody and control of the records
would normally be transferred to the archives. It could be an archival facility that operates as
an affiliate of a custodian through a contract or agency relationship. In this situation, custody
may be transferred but control must be retained by the custodian.

This provision does not permit disclosure to a private archive such as one operated by a private
museum or historical society.

Before disclosure takes place under this provision, the custodian must first determine whether
the information has enduring value.

DISCLOSURE BY MINISTER OR DEPARTMENT (Section 39)

Under section 39(1), the Minister or the Department may disclose individually identifying
diagnostic, treatment and care information without the consent of the individual who is the
subject of the information to another Minister of the Government of Alberta for the purpose of
developing public policy.

Examples of this purpose would be the disclosure of information on specific types of cases so
that services to those individuals can be coordinated across various government departments
in Alberta or the disclosure of information to develop programs or services for specific target
populations where they are going to be delivered by various government departments – e.g.,
programs for children, seniors, etc.

Section 39(2) enables the Minister or Department to enter into an agreement with another
Minister of the Government of Alberta or a Minister of the Government of Canada or of any
other province, or a person or entity in accordance with regulations made under the Alberta
Health Care Insurance Act, respecting the disclosure of individually identifying registration
information without the consent of the individual who is the subject of the information.

Agreements under this provision may be needed to establish the mechanisms and
accountability structures for federal-provincial or inter-provincial funding of health programs
or services.

 8.12

DISCLOSURE TO MINISTER (Section 40)

Under this section, a custodian other than the Minister may disclose individually identifying
health information to the Minister without the consent of the individual who is the subject of
the information if, in the opinion of the custodian, the disclosure is necessary or desirable to
enable the Minister to carry out the duties of the Minister.

The disclosure of individually identifying information to the Minister under this section is
discretionary. In forming an opinion about whether the information is necessary or desirable
to enable the Minister to carry out the duties of the Minister, the custodian must first apply the
principles of disclosing the least amount of information (section 58(1)), at the highest level
of anonymity (section 57)), and must consider as an important factor any expressed wishes
of the individual who is the subject of the information (section 58(2)). The custodian should
also ensure that the reason for disclosing the information is to enable the Minister to carry out
ministerial responsibilities, not for other purposes unrelated to those responsibilities or duties.

DISCLOSURE FOR HEALTH SYSTEM PURPOSES

Sections 46 and 47 permit the disclosure of individually identifying health information to the
Minister or Department or to a Regional Health Authority for any of the authorized purposes
listed in section 27(2).

The authorized purposes in section 27(2) which can only be carried out within the geographic
area in which the custodian has jurisdiction to promote the objectives for which the custodian
is responsible are:

 • planning and resource allocation;
 • health system management;
 • public health surveillance; and
 • health policy development.

Refer to section 7.4.2 in Chapter 7 of this Publication for more information and examples of
these authorized purposes.

 8.13.1  DISCLOSURE TO MINISTER AND DEPARTMENT (Section 46)

Under section 46(1), the Minister or Department may request another custodian to disclose
individually identifying health information for any of the section 27(2) purposes if:

 • the Minister or the Department is authorized by an enactment of Alberta or Canada to

obtain the information from the other custodian (46(1)(a)); or

 • the information relates to a health service provided by the other custodian that is:

–  fully or partially paid for by the Department or provided using financial, physical or

human resources provided, administered or paid for by the Department, or

–  the information is prescribed in the regulations as information that the Minister or the

Department may request. (46(1)(b)).

See section 1(1)(m) of the Act for a definition of “health service”.

“Fully paid” refers to health services that are funded completely by the Department.

“Partially paid” refers to health services that are partially funded by the Department (e.g., a
portion of chiropractic services) with the rest of the services being paid for privately.

In addition to health services that are fully or partially paid for by the Department, if the health
service is provided through the use of financial (money), physical (building, equipment) or
human (employees or other affiliates) resources that are provided, administered or paid for by
the Department, disclosure of the health information would fall within section 46(1).

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

This section allows the Minister or Department to compel another custodian to disclose health
information where that information relates to a health service provided by that custodian that
is fully or partially funded by the Department (section 46(1)(b)(i)) or if the information is
prescribed in regulations as information the Minister or Department may request (section 46(1)
(b)(ii)). Where health information is requested under subsection (1)(b), the Department is
required to submit a privacy impact assessment which describes the process, safeguards and
impact of the disclosure, to the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner.

If the requirements of section 46(1)(a) or (b) are met, subject to section 46(5), the custodian
must disclose the information requested (section 46(2)).

The information may be disclosed without the consent of the individual who is the subject of
the information (section 46(4)).

In addition to following the procedure outlined in the section, the Minister or Department has a
duty to collect the minimal amount of information at the highest level of anonymity, along with
demonstrating a need to know the information that is being requested. In most cases, non-
identifying health information will be sufficient.

For example, aggregate information would likely be sufficient for health system
management purposes.

 8.14

DISCLOSURE TO A RHA OR PROVINCIAL HEALTH BOARDS (Section 47)

Under section 47(1), certain other custodians may request a custodian (e.g., a physician,
approved hospital, the Department, etc.) to disclose to the requesting custodian individually
identifying health information for any of the section 27(2) purposes if:

 • the requesting custodian is authorized by an enactment of Alberta or Canada to obtain the

information from the other custodian (47(1)(a); or

 • the information relates to a health service provided by the other custodian that is:

–  fully or partially paid for by the requesting custodian; or
–  provided using financial, physical or human resources provided, administered or paid

for by the requesting custodian. (47(1)(b))

See the discussion under section 8.13.1 of this Chapter regarding a “health service” and “fully
or partially paid for”.

Unless the disclosure is authorized by an enactment of Alberta or Canada, under section 46(2),
the custodian receiving the request may refuse to disclose the information if the disclosure
could reasonably be expected:

 • to result in immediate and grave harm to the mental or physical health or safety of the

individual who is the subject of the information;

 • to threaten the mental or physical health or safety of another individual; or
 • to pose a threat to public safety.

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

See section 3.3.1 (Discretionary Exceptions) in Chapter 3 of this Publication for an
explanation and examples of immediate and grave harm, threatening mental or physical
health or safety and threatening public safety.

If a custodian refuses to disclose information because of the factors in section 47(2), the
custodian must provide the requesting custodian with non-identifying health information in the
form requested by that custodian, and the requesting custodian may ask for a review by the
Commissioner of the refusal to disclose (section 47(3)).

If the custodian refusing to disclose is a member of a health professional body, the
Commissioner must inform that body of the review and provide an opportunity for that body to
make comments relating to the review (section 47(4)).

In addition to following the procedure outlined in the section, a custodian such as a health
authority would have to consider collecting the least amount of information at the highest
level of anonymity, along with having to demonstrate a need to know the information that is
being requested. There would be very limited situations where a health authority would be
requesting identifiable health information from other custodians (e.g., physicians). In most
cases, non-identifying health information will be sufficient. For example, aggregate information
would likely be sufficient for health system management purposes.

Individually identifying health information may be disclosed under section 47 without consent.

 8.15

DISCLOSURE FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES

Division 3 of Part 5 of the Act sets out the rules for custodians and researchers regarding the
disclosure of health information for research purposes.

“Research” is defined in section 1(1)(v) to mean academic, applied or scientific research that
necessitates the use of individually identifying health information.

“Health information” for the purposes of Division 3 of Part 5 means individually identifying
diagnostic, treatment and care information or individually identifying registration information,
or both.

 8.15.1  SUBMISSION OF A RESEARCH PROPOSAL TO A RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD

Under section 49, a person who intends to conduct research (as defined in section 1(1) (v))
using health information in the custody or under the control of a custodian or health
information repository must submit a proposal to a research ethics board (REB) for review by
that REB containing the information specified by the regulations and any other information
required by the REB.

A “health information repository” means an agency, corporation or other entity designated by
the Minister to act as a health information repository in accordance with Part 6.1 of the Act.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

A “research ethics board” as defined in section 1(1)(v.1) means a body designated by the
regulations as a research ethics board.

This definition does not include clinical or bio-clinical ethics review committees. Some REBs
work conjointly with other bodies, such as health authorities. The University boards, for
example, have this broader mandate.

The Designation Regulation lists the following committees and boards as Research Ethics
Boards for the purposes of Part 5, Division 3 of the Act:

 • College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta – Research Ethics Review Committee;
 • Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research – Community Health Ethics Research

Review Committee;

 • University of Alberta – Health Research Ethics Board;
 • University of Calgary – Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board;
 • University of Lethbridge – Human Subject Research Committee.

In order to be eligible for and to maintain designation under the Health Information Act, a
research ethics board must meet the following criteria:

 • consist of at least 5 members, including both men and women:

–  at least 2 of whom have broad expertise in research methods;
–  at least one of whom is knowledgeable in research ethics;
–  at least one of whom is knowledgeable in the area of protection of individual privacy;
–  at least one of whom represents the community served by the ethics committee;
–  operate under the sponsorship of a research institution, professional body, regional

health authority or other publicly funded body;

–  undertake at least 12 to 24 ethics reviews per year as the primary ethics review board;
–  arrange appointments to the committee to balance the need to maintain continuity

with the need to ensure diversity of opinion and the opportunity to spread knowledge
and experience gained from membership throughout the hosting organization
and community.

A board or committee wishing to be designated under the Designation Regulation may apply to
the Minister of Alberta Health and Wellness by providing the following information about the
proposed research ethics board:

 • its terms of reference;
 • its authorities and responsibilities;
 • its requirements for submission of research proposals;
 • demonstration of compliance with the standards set by the Tri-Council Policy Statement on
Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (September 17, 1998 or later versions as
they are implemented);

 • its frequency/structure of meetings;

© 2006-2011  Government of Alberta
Health and Wellness

244

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

 • its membership and membership selection/replacement process (for committees who

would normally not disclose the names of members, providing the Minister with a listing
of the areas of expertise and gender of the members may be sufficient); and/or

 • a description of its relationships with any other ethics committees within the institution/

organization.

The Tri-Council is a consortium of three federal research funding Councils – the Canadian
Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), formerly Medical Research Council (MRC)), the
Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and the Social Sciences and the
Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). The Tri-Council policy statement replaced the previous
MRC and SSHRC guidelines with an updated and more comprehensive document covering all
research with human subjects supported by the three Research Councils.

The Minister retains the authority to remove a research ethics board’s designation under the
Designation Regulation if it fails to maintain the required criteria for designation.

 8.15.2  ROLE OF RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD

Under section 50(1), a research ethics board reviews proposals to conduct research. The
review must:

 • consider whether the researcher should be required to obtain consents for the disclosure of
the health information to be used in the research from the individuals who are the subjects
of the information (section 50(1)a)); and

 • assess whether, in the opinion of the research ethics board:

–  the proposed research is of sufficient importance that the public interest in the

proposed research outweighs to a substantial degree the public interest in protecting the
privacy of the individuals who are the subjects of the health information to be used in
the research;

–  the researcher is qualified to carry out the research;
–  adequate safeguards will be in place at the time the research will be carried out to

protect the privacy of the individuals who are the subjects of the health information to
be used in the research and the confidentiality of that information; and

–  obtaining the consents referred to in clause (a) is unreasonable, impractical or not

feasible. (section 50(1)(b))

Form of Consent
If a research ethics board determines under section 50(1)(a) that a researcher needs to obtain
consents from individuals for the disclosure of their health information to be used in the
research, the consent form should be approved by the REB and meet the REB’s guidelines or
standards for consent. Such guidelines may require that the consent:

 • be typed on the letterhead of the institution or organization administering the consent;
 • use plain language that lay persons will understand;

© 2006-2011  Government of Alberta
Health and Wellness

245

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

 • include:

–  the purpose of the study;
–  a description of the types of information which the researcher requests to be released

by the custodian;

–  the purposes for which the information is to be used;
–  the name and address of the individual(s) or organization authorized to receive

the information;

–  the name and address of the individual (the personal health number and date of birth

may be needed by certain custodians to identify the individual);

–  the time period during which the disclosure is authorized or remains valid;
–  a statement that the study participant holds the custodian (and its affiliates) harmless

from any and all claims which may arise as a result of the disclosure of the information;

–  a confidentiality clause or statement that restricts access to the information to only

certain persons (e.g., the researcher(s), the sponsor, Food and Drug Authority officials
(if this is needed for pharmaceutical trials), the research ethics board auditors, etc.);

–  confirmation that the individual providing consent is 18 years of age or older;
–  spaces for the signatures of the study participant or his or her parent or guardian (if the

participant is under 18 years of age) and a witness;

–  space for the study participant to identify the date of signature;
–  an acknowledgement that the study participant has been made aware of the reasons
why the health information is needed and the risks and benefits to the individual of
consenting or refusing to consent to the disclosure;

–  a statement that the consent may be revoked at any time; and
–  a statement that the information disclosed to the researcher will not be made available
to any other party without further authorization and that the researcher will have
adequate safeguards in place to protect the privacy of the study participants and the
confidentiality of that information.

Assessment By Research Ethics Board
The assessment that a research ethics board must undertake in section 50(1)(b) is both stricter
and broader than the privacy impact assessment (PIA) that custodians must undertake in
sections 64(1), 70, 71 and 46.

It is stricter because under section 50(1)(b)(i), the REB must form an opinion that the potential
privacy – adverse impacts of the research are substantially outweighed by the public benefits
expected from it. It is not enough for a researcher to be able to show how he or she would
mitigate potential privacy impacts or that there would be some (or limited) public interest in
the proposed research.

The assessment under section 50 is also broader than a PIA because it includes an assessment
of both the qualifications of the researcher as well as the practicality or reasonableness of
obtaining consents from the study participants (section 50(1)(b)(ii) and (iv)).

© 2006-2011  Government of Alberta
Health and Wellness

246

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

Just as in PIAs, however, an important part of the assessment is whether the researcher will
have adequate safeguards in place at the time the research will be carried out to protect the
privacy of the individual subjects and the confidentiality of their health information (section
50(1)(b)(iii)).

If data matching is performed for the purpose of conducting research, in addition to the
requirements set out in sections 49 to 56, a custodian must carry out a PIA, meeting the
requirements of section 70(3) or 71(2).

For more information on privacy impact assessments, see section 5.2.7 (Duty to Prepare
Privacy Impact Assessments) in Chapter 5 of this Publication. For more information on
adequate safeguards for protection of the privacy and confidentiality of health information,
see section 5.2.3 (Duty to Protect Health Information) in Chapter 5 of this Publication.

When making an assessment under section 50(1)(b) as to whether the public interest in the
research outweighs to a substantial degree the public interest in protecting the privacy of study
participants, a research ethics board must consider the degree to which the proposed research
may contribute to:

 • identification, prevention or treatment of illness or disease;
 • scientific understanding relating to health;
 • promotion and protection of the health of individuals and communities;
 • improved delivery of health services; or
 • improvements in health system management (section 50(2)).

Research ethics boards follow the guidelines in the Tri-Council Policy Statement, as well as
their own regulations or guidelines regarding conflict of interest as this applies to the research
proposal. This enables them to consider the degree to which the researcher is independent
from or motivated by vested commercial or other private interests.

A research ethics board may determine that it is unreasonable, impractical or not feasible to
obtain consents to disclosure of the information from the study participants.

Some REBs do not require consent for disclosure of health information when patients are not
being contacted directly. This could occur when the research involves a chart review, or access
to certain data (e.g., access to Cancer Registry data) or where a researcher has made a general
request to members of the public to respond to a research questionnaire.

Response of Research Ethics Board
Under section 50(3), the research ethics board must prepare a response to the researcher
setting out:

 • its recommendation about obtaining consents from study participants under

section 50(1)(a);

 • its assessment of the matters under section 50(1)(b) (public interest in research

outweighing potential privacy impacts; qualifications of researcher; adequacy of safeguards
to protect privacy and confidentiality; practicality, feasibility of obtaining consents); and

 • any conditions that the committee considers should be imposed on the researcher.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

A copy of the REB’s response must be sent to the Information and Privacy Commissioner
(section 50(4)). The notification of the Commissioner is intended to ensure that his office is
kept aware of any potential impacts on individual privacy that may arise from the disclosure of
individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information or registration information
to be used for a research purpose. The Commissioner can publish the research ethics board’s
response on the OIPC public website (section 50.1).

This provision is not meant to create additional work for research ethics boards. If the items in
section 50(3) are included in the final approval letter to the researcher, providing a copy of that
letter to the Commissioner would be sufficient.

If the research ethics board is not satisfied regarding any of the matters that were part of
its assessment in section 50(1)(b), the researcher may not apply to a custodian or health
information repository for disclosure of the health information (section 51).

 8.15.3  APPLICATION TO CUSTODIAN FOR DISCLOSURE FOR RESEARCH PURPOSE

If the research ethics board is satisfied with the assessment done under section 50(1)(b), the
researcher may forward to one or more custodians or health information repositories: the
proposal submitted to the research ethics board by the researcher (as referred to in section 49);
the response of the research ethics board to the researcher’s proposal; and a written application
for (i) disclosure of health information to be used in the research, (ii) performance of data
matching; and/or (iii) performance of any other service to facilitate the research (section 52).

Even if a custodian has received an application from a researcher supported by a positive
response from a research ethics board, the custodian can exercise its discretion not to disclose
the health information or perform data matching or other services to facilitate the research
applied for (section 53(1).

If the custodian decides to disclose the health information or perform data matching or other
services to facilitate the research,

(a)  the custodian

(i)  must impose on the researcher the conditions suggested by the research ethics

board, and

(ii)  may impose other conditions on the researcher, and

(b)  if the research ethics board recommended that consents referred to in section 50(1) (a)
be obtained, the researcher must obtain the consents before the disclosure of the
health information or performance of data matching or other services (section 53(2)).

A health information repository that has received the documents referred to in section 52 may
disclose the health information or perform data matching or other services to facilitate the
research only in accordance with the regulations. (section 53(3))

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

 8.15.4  AGREEMENT WITH RESEARCHER

Pursuant to section 54(1), if a custodian decides to disclose health information to a researcher
or perform data matching or other services to facilitate the research the researcher must
enter into an agreement with the custodian. The researcher must agree:

 • to comply with the Act and the regulations, any conditions imposed by the custodian

relating to the use, protection, disclosure, return or disposal of the health information, and
any requirement imposed by the custodian to provide safeguards against identification,
direct or indirect, of a subject individual;

 • to use the health information only for the purpose of conducting the proposed research;
 • not to publish the health information in a form that could reasonably enable the identify of

an individual who is the subject of the information to be readily ascertained;

 • not to make any attempt to contact an individual who is the subject of the health

information to obtain additional health information unless the individual has provided the
custodian with the consent referred to in section 55;

 • to allow the custodian to access or inspect the researcher’s premises to confirm that the
researcher is complying with the Health Information Act, the regulations, conditions and
requirements in 54(1)(a); and

 • to pay the costs, if any, set by the custodian under section 54(3).

“Readily ascertained” means that the individual’s name or other identifiers or distinguishing
characteristics associated with an individual can be determined or deduced without having to
apply a sophisticated technical method or process, or without having the particular technical
expertise to do so.

The identity of an individual can be said to be “readily ascertained” if:

 • it can be determined by combining available data or information within the same or in

several different records;

 • it can be determined by comparing information representing distinguishing characteristics

with other information sources having both the distinguishing characteristics and the
names or other identifiers of individuals; and

 • only readily available or conventional computer hardware, software and technical expertise

is used.

Where, for example, a pharmaceutical company is sponsoring clinical trial research, the
custodian and sponsor will negotiate the arrangements for research in a separate agreement.
A custodian may use an affiliate with hospital privileges to conduct the research.

Health and Wellness

249

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

Once the proposal for this type of research has been approved by the research ethics board, the
custodian should enter into a research agreement with the affiliate(s) who is (are) conducting
the sponsored research. Since an affiliate may conduct a number of sponsored clinical trial
research projects for a custodian, it may be more efficient to have a form of master agreement
signed in advance with each affiliate who will be conducting research. The master agreement
would bind the researcher to the requirements of section 54. As each research proposal is
approved by the Research Ethics Board, the details of that particular research project, health
information to be disclosed, security safeguards, access restrictions, etc. would be added to the
affiliate’s master agreement by way of a schedule.

See Appendix 4 of this Publication for the Components of a Research Agreement under
Section 54. Custodians should seek legal advice in the drafting of any research agreement.

Custodians who are also public bodies under the FOIP Act should note that the research
agreement requirements set out in section 54(1) are not the same as those set out in section 40
of the FOIP Act and section 8 of the FOIP Regulation which apply to disclosure of other types of
personal information for research or statistical purposes.

Once the agreement in section 54(1) has been entered into, the custodian may disclose the
requested health information to the researcher or perform data matching or other services
to facilitate the research. The disclosure may be done with the consent of the individuals
who are the subjects of the information, where that has been recommended by the research
ethics board, or without the individuals’ consent where obtaining consents has not been
recommended (section 54(2)).

Under section 54(3), the custodian may determine the costs of preparing information for
disclosure or performing data matching or other services; making copies of health information;
and obtaining the consents required under section 55, if the researcher wishes to contact the
subjects of the research. The costs must not exceed the actual cost of providing those services.
The fees set out in the Fee Schedule under the Health Information Regulation do not apply to
the costs determined by the custodian under this section.

 8.15.5  CONSENT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

If the researcher wishes to contact the individuals who are the subjects of the information
disclosed under section 54(2) to obtain additional health information, the custodian or one of
its affiliates must first obtain consents from those individuals to their being contacted for that
purpose (section 55).

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

 8.15.6  COURT ORDER

Under section 54(1)(e), a researcher must agree to allow the custodian to access or inspect the
researcher’s premises to confirm that the researcher is complying with the Act, the regulations
and the conditions and requirements in 54(1)(a). Section 56(1) provides that if a researcher
refuses to allow a custodian or health information repository to access or inspect its premises
in accordance with the research agreement, the custodian may apply to the Court of Queen’s
Bench by notice of motion for an order to enforce compliance with the research agreement.

If the court is satisfied that there are reasonable and probable grounds to believe that access
to premises or the production or removal of documents is necessary for the purpose of
determining whether the research agreement is being complied with, the court may make any
order it considers necessary to enforce compliance with the agreement (section 56(2)).

An order under section 56(2) may authorize a custodian or health Information repository to:

 • enter and search any premises of the researcher where the research is conducted;
 • operate or cause to be operated any computer system of the researcher to search any data

contained in or available to the system and produce a document from the data; and

 • seize and make copies of any documents of the researcher that are or may be relevant to

the investigation. (section 56(3))

“Document” is defined in section 56(6) to include any correspondence, memorandum, book,
plan, map, drawing, diagram, pictorial or graphic work, photograph, film, microfilm, sound
recording, videotape, machine readable record or other material or thing, regardless of physical
form or characteristics.

An application for an order under this section may be made ex parte unless the Court orders
otherwise (section 56(5)).

“Ex Parte” means that the notice of motion does not have to be served on the researcher and
the order can be obtained in the absence of the researcher (section 56(4)). The Court may
decide that providing notice of the application to the researcher may not be expedient under
the circumstances or that it would enable the researcher to modify or destroy evidence needed
for the investigation.

Any  documents  seized  by  the  custodian  or  health  information  repository  pursuant  to  a  court
order must be returned to the researcher within 60 days after the conclusion of the investigation,
including any hearing or appeal (section 56(5)).

THI NGS TO REMEMB ER

DISCLOSURE OF HEALTH INFORMATION

 • A custodian must not disclose health information except in accordance with the

Health Information Act.

 • A custodian may disclose non-identifying health information to anyone for any

purpose but must inform a non-custodian that the Commissioner must be notified if
the recipient intends to use the information for data matching.

 • A custodian must disclose the least amount of health information at the highest

level of anonymity possible unless the disclosure is for providing health services or
for determining the individual’s eligibility to receive a health service.

 • A custodian must consider any expressed wishes of the individual who is the

subject of the information and any other factors the custodian considers relevant in
deciding how much health information to disclose.

 • An affiliate must only disclose the health information necessary to carry out his/her

responsibilities as assigned by the custodian.

 • A custodian may only disclose non-recorded individually identifying health
information for the purpose for which the information was provided to
the custodian.

 • A custodian must make a reasonable effort to ensure that the person to whom the

disclosure is made is the person intended and authorized to receive the information.
 • When a custodian discloses a record containing individually identifying diagnostic,
treatment and care information without consent, including disclosure to another
custodian, the disclosing custodian must make a notation of the name of
the recipient, the date and purpose of the disclosure and a description of the
information disclosed. The disclosure notation may be in paper or electronic form,
may be put on the individual’s health or drug record or in a book or “disclosure
log”. The notation must be kept for 10 years. This requirement is not applicable
when a custodian allows other custodians electronic access to individually
identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information stored in a database,
provided that, when the information is disclosed, the database automatically keeps
an electronic log of a name or number that identifies the custodian to whom the
information is disclosed, the date and time that the information is disclosed and a
description of the information that is disclosed.

 • A custodian that discloses individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care
information must in most cases inform the recipient in writing of the purpose for
the disclosure and the custodian’s authority for disclosing the information (see
Notices to Recipients (section 42)).

THINGS TO REMEMBER

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

 • A custodian may refuse to disclose individually identifying health information

without consent under sections 35, 36, 37, 37.1, 37.3, 38 and 40. These sections
are discretionary but a disclosure of information in some instances may be required
(eg. In the case of a warrant, subpoena or court order or if a custodian has reason to
believe that a child is at risk or if the custodian has diagnostic, treatment and care
information that is critical to treating an individual).

 • A custodian must disclose individually identifying health information to the Minister

or the Department if the information is requested for health system purposes
(section 46) and the authority for the request is from another statute or relates to
a health service funded by the Department. However, if the information requested
relates to a health service funded by the Department, the Department must first
prepare a Privacy Impact Assessment and submit it to the Commissioner for review
and comment.

 • Before disclosing the information obtained from another custodian for health

system purposes to a regional health authority, the Department must also consider
the comments of the Commissioner made in response to the Privacy Impact
Assessment.

To Whom May a Custodian Disclose Individually Identifying Diagnostic,
Treatment and Care Information to?

 • The individual who is the subject of the information or to an authorized

representative of the individual;

 • If the custodian has the individual’s consent, the custodian may disclose the

individual’s identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information in accordance
with the consent. (see ‘Some Things to Remember About Consent’, the forms for
consent under section 34(2) in Appendix 1 of this publication and Chapter 8 of
this publication)

 • In the absence of an individual’s consent, a custodian may disclose individually
identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information, as follows, subject to the
general rules in the Act regarding the least amount of information at the highest
degree of anonymity, to:
–  any other custodian for purposes authorized by section 27 of the Act (see ‘Some
Things to Remember about Use’ – Authorized Purposes and Chapter 7 of this
publication);

–  any person who is responsible for providing continuing treatment and care to the
individual or to other persons for the purposes listed in section 35 of the Act;

–  the Provincial Archives of Alberta or to an archives that is subject to the

Health Information Act or to the FOIP Act for permanent preservation and

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

FUNDAMENTALS OF CONSENT

When is Consent under Section 34(2) Required?
Consent under this section is normally required whenever a custodian discloses
individually identifying health information (i.e., diagnostic, treatment and care
information, registration information or health services provider information) to non-
custodians. Examples of requests for disclosure where consent would be required
include disclosure to an insurance company, to an employer or to a physician providing
services to the Workers’ Compensation Board.

Requirements for Consent under Section 34(2)
 • Must be provided in writing or electronically;
 • Must include:

–  authority for the custodian to disclose the health information specified in

the consent;

–  the purpose for which the health information may be disclosed;
–  the identity of the person to whom the information is to be disclosed;
–  an acknowledgement that the individual has been made aware of the reasons

why the health information is needed and the risks and benefits of consenting or
refusing to consent;

–  the date the consent is effective and the date, if any, on which the consent

expires; and

–  a statement that the consent may be revoked at any time.

 • Revocation of consent must be provided in writing or electronically.
 • Consent or revocation of consent must be signed by the person providing it.

When is Consent under Section 34(2) Not Required?
Consent is not required when a custodian discloses individually identifying health
information to other custodians for authorized purposes (see section 27 of the Act)
(see ‘Some Things to Remember About Use’ – Authorized Purposes and Chapter 7 of
this Publication).

Consent is not required when a custodian is disclosing information to non-custodians
in accordance with the following exceptions: (Note that a custodian may still exercise
discretion in disclosing individually identifying health information under sections 35,
36, 37, 37.1, 37.3, 38 and 40)

 • Disclosure of individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care information to

the persons and under the conditions listed in section 35 of the Act:
–  To another government (provincial, territorial or federal) when the individual

receives health services in Alberta which are paid for by that other government
(section 35(1) (a.1)).

his duties (section 40);

Disclosure to prevent or limit fraud or abuse of health services.

 • A custodian may disclose the specified information in sub-section (2) of 37.1

without consent to a police service or Minister of Justice and Attorney General
where the custodian reasonably believes

AND
–  that disclosing the information will have the effect of detecting or preventing

fraud or limiting abuse in the use of health services.

Disclosure to protect public health and safety.

 • A custodian may disclose the specified information in sub-section (2) of 37.3
without consent from the individual where the custodian reasonably believes
–  that the information relates to the possible commission of an offence (past,
present, or future) by the individual, under federal or provincial legislation,

AND
–  that disclosing the information will have the effect of protecting the health and

safety of Albertans.

When is Disclosure Without Consent Authorized or Required under
Section 35(1)(p)?
Some examples of other statutes that authorize or require the disclosure or certain types
of individually identifying health information are:

 • Criminal Code (Canada) – provides indirect authority to compel disclosure of

information as specified in warrants or subpoenas;

 • Fatality Inquiries Act – requires custodians to report unexpected deaths to a

medical examiner;

 • Protection for Persons in Care Act – requires custodians to report on the possible

abuse of an adult in care;

 • Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act - requires custodians to report cases of

children who are in need of intervention services; and

 • Public Health Act – requires custodians to notify the Medical Officer of Health
regarding certain communicable diseases and provides for the disclosure of
information on recalcitrant patients.

CHAPTER EIGHT – Disclosure of Health Information

Other Considerations Regarding Consent

 • Custodians need to be particularly cautious about disclosing any individually
identifying health information if there is a reasonable expectation of any harm
resulting to the individual.

 • If a custodian so chooses, the custodian may request the individuals’ consent

prior to disclosing information to custodians or non-custodians that are listed in
sections 35, 36, 37, 37.1, 37.3, 38 of the Act, even though there is no requirement
to obtain consent in these instances.

 • When there is a need to obtain consent from an individual who is under the age

of 18 years or from an individual who is over the age of 18 years but who may be
cognitively impaired, custodians must apply their clinical judgment to determine
whether the individual understands and appreciates the nature and consequences
of providing or not providing their consent. If the individual cannot understand
and appreciate the nature and consequences of providing or not providing their
consent, the consent of a parent, guardian or other authorized representative of the
individual (section 104(1)(c) to (i)) must be obtained.

 • Consent from a parent or guardian obtained for a child under the age of 18 years
would not remain valid for an individual once they are over the age of 18 years
and a new consent would need to be obtained from the individual. Consent may be
required from a mature minor.

 • Consent from a parent or guardian or from the individual him or herself (if over the
age of 18 years) would need to be obtained from or for each member of a family.
One consent covering all members of a family would not be sufficient.

OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER NINE

This Chapter will cover:

 • the roles and responsibilities of custodians, affiliates, health professional bodies, the

Department and the Information and Privacy Commissioner;

 • the tasks and issues that custodians need to address to ensure compliance with the Act;
 • the identification of affiliates;
 • situations in which custodians may become affiliates and the process for such a transition;

 9.2

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

 9.2.1

CUSTODIANS

Custodians (as defined in section 1(1)(f)) as the “gatekeepers” of health information, are
responsible for maintaining, protecting and safeguarding health information in their custody or
under their control. They are also responsible for safeguarding health information when it is
transmitted or transported to other custodians or others outside the controlled arena, including
transmission or transport outside the province.

See ‘How the Act Works’ in Section 1.3.2 of Chapter 1 and the definition of Custody and
Control in ‘To Whom Does the Health Information Act Apply?’ in section 1.4.2 in Chapter 1
of this Publication.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER NINE – Administration of the Act

To comply with the Act, each custodian should establish internal processes and procedures
suited to the organization’s size, structure, specific circumstances and anticipated workload. A
custodian’s responsibilities under the Act include:

 • receiving and responding to requests for health information, meeting the duty to assist

applicants and collecting any fees as set out in the Act (sections 7-10, 12, 15, 17 and 67);
 • deciding what information will be released and what information will be excepted from

disclosure under the legislation (section 11);

 • receiving and responding to requests for correction or amendment (sections 13-15);
 • fulfilling the various duties of the custodian relating to the collection, use and disclosure of
health information, including the rules regarding the least amount of information and the
highest degree of anonymity (sections 18-72);

 • responding to the Information and Privacy Commissioner to resolve requests for reviews

and complaints under the Act (sections 73-82, 84, 85);

 • assisting the public by designating one or more individuals to be responsible for the

implementation and administration of the Act; and

 • making available any policies and procedures regarding the implementation of the Act

(sections 62 and 63).

 9.2.2  AFFILIATES

“Affiliates” as defined in section 1(1)(a) must comply with the Act and regulations, and any
policies and procedures established or adopted under section 63.

Any collection, use or disclosure of health information by an affiliate is considered to be
a collection, use or disclosure by the custodian (section 62). Any disclosure of health
information to an affiliate is considered to be a disclosure to the custodian. Although affiliates
of a custodian must comply with the Act, the regulations and the custodian’s policies and
procedures, the custodian remains ultimately responsible for compliance under the Health
Information Act.

 9.2.3  HEALTH PROFESSIONAL OR OTHER REGULATORY BODIES

Bodies that regulate the practice of health professionals such as the College of Physicians and
Surgeons of Alberta, the College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta as well as
associations of individual custodians, such as the Alberta Medical Association and the Alberta
Pharmacists’ Association, are not custodians.

Representatives of many of these organizations were involved in working groups assisting
Alberta Health and Wellness with the development of the regulations under the Act and as
members of the Health Information Act Implementation Steering Committee. These bodies
retain a continuing role in assisting their members in interpreting and applying the Act relevant
to their sector.

CHAPTER NINE – Administration of the Act

 9.2.4  MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HEALTH INFORMATION ACT

The Lieutenant Governor in Council designates the Minister Responsible for the Act by Order in
Council. The Minister of Alberta Health and Wellness has been given this responsibility.

The Minister has overall responsibility for the general administration of the Act across the
province, including preparing and submitting amendments to the Act and the Regulations.

 9.2.5  ALBERTA HEALTH AND WELLNESS

The Department of Alberta Health and Wellness supports the Minister in all aspects of
implementing and administering the legislation across all custodians.

The Department is responsible for overall leadership and direction in communicating with the
public about the Act.

The Department is also responsible for the overall leadership and direction of training activities
related to the implementation of the Act, including the development of training delivery media.

The Department will provide the following services and products to custodians:

 • help desk support services, particularly to custodians providing a single health service or

who work in a clinic to assist in the application and explanation of the Act;

 • samples of communications templates such as newsletters, brochures and posters,

developed in consultation with custodians and various organizations;

 • training and awareness materials for custodians to deliver to their staff and training courses
for persons designated as responsible for the implementation and administration of the Act;
and

 • updates to this Publication as the Act is interpreted through orders from the Commissioner.

 9.2.6

INFORMATION AND PRIVACY COMMISSIONER

The Information and Privacy Commissioner is an Officer of the Legislature who is independent
from government. The Commissioner is responsible for reviewing decisions of custodians and
affiliates under the Act; conducting investigations; providing advice; and resolving disputes.

The Commissioner must report annually to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly on the
work of the Commissioner’s Office and such other matters relating to the protection of health
information as the Commissioner considers appropriate.

The duties, powers and responsibilities of the Commissioner and the role of the
Commissioner’s Office are set out in Part 7 of the Act and in Chapter 10 of this Publication.

CHAPTER NINE – Administration of the Act

 9.3

IDENTIFYING RESPONSIBLE AFFILIATES

Section 62 requires each custodian to identify its affiliates who will be responsible for ensuring
compliance with the Act, the regulations and the policies and procedures established or
adopted by the custodian under section 63. Carrying out this requirement would include
designating a person who will have overall responsibility for ensuring compliance with the
Health Information Act (i.e., a responsible affiliate or Health Information Coordinator, in some
organizations).

According to the definition of “affiliate” in section 1(1)(a), the affiliates identified would be:
the custodian’s employees; a person who performs a service for the custodian as an
appointee, volunteer or student or under a contract or agency relationship with the
custodian; health service providers (i.e., physicians, nurses, etc.) who exercise the right to
admit and treat patients at a hospital under the Hospitals Act; an information manager
as defined in section 66 (1); and a person who is designated under the regulations
to be an affiliate. The regulation enables a custodian to apply to the Minister to
be designated as an affiliate of another custodian. The custodian must first obtain
written consent from the other custodian. In deciding whether to permit a custodian
to become an affiliate of another custodian, the Minister is not required to hold
a hearing. However, the Minister must be satisfied the applicant custodian has
sufficiently addressed the following considerations:

 • the public interest;
 • the ability of the applicant to provide individuals with reasonable access to their personal

health information;

 • the ability of the applicant to comply with HIA; and
 • whether designating the applicant as an affiliate will improve the efficiency and

effectiveness of applying HIA.

An affiliate wishing to resume its duties as a custodian may do so by providing
written notice to the Minister and to the custodian to whom it was affiliated.

 9.4

HEALTH INFORMATION ACT ADMINISTRATION

The following issues and tasks need to be addressed by each custodian before the Act comes
into effect.

The following is a summary of the more detailed Health Information Act Administration
Checklist in Appendix 3 of this Publication.

1.  Establish a structure necessary to administer the Act.

 • Designate (a) responsible person(s)

Custodians have a number of responsibilities and requirements related to the implementation,
administration and operation of the Health Information Act. Regardless of the size and
structure of a custodian, fulfilling these responsibilities requires clear lines of responsibility and
coordination within each organization.

© 2006-2011  Government of Alberta
Health and Wellness

264

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER NINE – Administration of the Act

The person designated will be responsible for ensuring that the necessary Health Information
Act related policies and procedures are established and followed, that the custodian is aware
of any amendments to the Health Information Act and ensures that the custodian’s policies
and procedures remain compliant with the Act. However, the custodian remains ultimately
responsible for compliance with the Act.

In the case of the Department, a regional health authority, provincial health boards, hospitals
and nursing homes, as well as large multi-practitioner clinics, the task of designating a
responsible person could be met by appointing an employee or other type of affiliate as a
Health Information Coordinator. In the case of custodians such as small pharmacies and single
physician offices, the licensed pharmacist, the physician or a member of their office staff could
be designated as the responsible person.

If the custodian organization is large or decentralized, such as a regional health authority, it
may choose to designate individuals responsible for the Health Information Act on a site by site
or geographic basis, rather than having one person responsible for all the implementation tasks
throughout the region or at all sites. Designated persons may be employees or agents of the
custodian.

In some cases, the Responsible Affiliate or Health Information Coordinator may also be
the person who is the FOIP Coordinator for the organization, under the FOIP Act. For other
custodians, the health records manager may be designated as the Responsible Affiliate or
Health Information Coordinator.

A single individual or agent may represent several custodians in a clinic or facility setting or in
instances where custodians do not have the resources themselves to administer the Act. These
arrangements should be formalized in some way (e.g., put in writing or added to a position
description) to ensure that the scope of responsibility is clear.

BEST PRACTICE: It may be more effective to have only one individual designated as the Responsible
Affiliate or Health Information Coordinator, with support from site or area/program contacts, as
necessary. If a single custodian is carrying out the duties of the responsible affiliate, he or she should
have an individual designated as a backup coordinator or responsible affiliate in the event of his or
her absence or inability to carry out these duties and responsibilities.

Whomever is designated as having these responsibilities should be fully trained and have access to
senior staff and decision-makers and the necessary resources and support.

In addition to the tasks set out in the Health Information Act Administration Checklist (and in
#1 through #6 of this section), the responsibilities of the Responsible Affiliate or Health
Information Coordinator include:

 • implementing policies, guidelines and procedures to manage the custodian’s compliance

with the provisions of the Act;

 • providing advice on the administration of the Act to the staff of the custodian;
 • managing the process for tracking and responding to requests for access to or for correction

or amendment of an individual’s own health information;

265

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER NINE – Administration of the Act

 • developing a plan for and ensuring that the business practices of the organization are

reviewed to comply with the privacy protection requirements of the Act;

 • coordinating any negotiations, mediations, investigations, and audits with the Office of the

Information and Privacy Commissioner; and

 • ensuring consistency in the application of other acts and regulations which relate to the

prohibition or restriction on disclosure of health information (section 4).

 • Establish an appropriate administration support team

Depending upon the projected volume of requests, the amount and type of health information
collected, used or disclosed, and the size and complexity of the organization, a custodian
may wish to establish a team to support the Responsible Affiliate or Health Information
Coordinator. In a large organization, such as a health authority, the team should include
senior representatives from the parts of the organization that collect, use or disclose health
information. It may also include a representative from information technology and systems,
information or records management, legal services and human resources.

 • Identify and communicate with other “affiliated” custodians

A regional health authority has a level of responsibility for subsidiary health corporations,
community health councils and perhaps hospitals and nursing homes funded to provide
services in the region. It is useful for the regional health authority to coordinate administration
activities with those other custodians who are also affiliates of the regional health authority.

2.  Establish a communications plan
The Department is responsible for overall leadership and direction in communicating with the
public about the Act.

In addition, each custodian should have an internal and external communication plan in place
to provide key messages about the custodian’s responsibilities and activities with regards to
the Act, awareness activities for patients, clients and affiliates about how the Act applies to
the custodian and any special messages and approaches to communicate with the media and
special groups that interact with the custodian.

3.  Establish a training plan and conduct awareness training for the custodian’s staff and

other affiliates.

Training and awareness sessions are very important and are a requirement under the Act. A
training plan in a medium to large organization should accommodate a variety of audiences
and their requirements, including senior staff, members of the governing authority, staff
who have daily contact with the public, site or facility Health Information Coordinators or
back–up Coordinators, and specific staff groups such as information management and records
management specialists, legal advisors, admitting office staff, etc.

Training and awareness in small offices or organizations generally requires that those in
positions of responsibility and those who interact directly with individual patients will
have to understand the rules in the Act, the implications of those rules, and administrative
requirements. (See Appendix 3).

CHAPTER NINE – Administration of the Act

4.  Assess the status quo
Custodians should periodically review their processes for collection, use, disclosure and
protection of health information:

 • Who are the affiliates of the custodian?
 • What are the current practices related to collection, access, use, disclosure, disposition,

data matching and security?

 • What are the current practices for records management and archives?
 • How are personal health numbers collected and used?
 • Are there other legal authorities that apply?
 • What policies are in place for consent?
 • When are privacy impact assessments required?
 • How are contracts developed and managed?

5.  Develop/maintain procedures for tracking and responding to health information requests
See #5 of the detailed Health Information Act Administration Checklist in Appendix 3 and also
see Chapters 2 and 3 of this Publication.

6.  What is the organization’s plan for ensuring compliance with the privacy provisions of

the Act?

See #6 of the detailed Health Information Act Administration Checklist in Appendix 3 and also
see Chapters 5, 6, 7, 8 and 11 of this Publication regarding privacy and security compliance.

 9.5

HEALTH RECORDS MANAGEMENT OR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS

The health records management and information management/technology function provide
major support to the Health Information Coordinator or responsible affiliate for the effective
administration of the Act. Each custodian should coordinate its efforts for managing,
administering, controlling, providing security for and preserving all the records containing
health information, including electronic data and information, in its custody or under its
control, in order to meet the requirements of the Act.

The responsibilities of persons carrying out the health records and information management
functions for a custodian include:

 • establishing and maintaining an adequate level of information control to ensure that all
records containing health information can be located and retrieved within the required
time limits;

 • establishing and maintaining information management systems for the custodian that

comply with the privacy protection provisions of the Act;

 • ensuring that health records retention and disposition schedules are established, approved
in an authorized fashion, and applied for all health information in the custody or under the
control of a custodian;

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER NINE – Administration of the Act

 • ensuring that adequate safeguards and information security measures are in place for the

protection of all health information;

 • establishing procedures for authenticating the identity of individuals and of those persons

to whom health information is disclosed;

 • establishing procedures, in accordance with the regulations, for stripping, encoding
or transforming individually identifying health information to create non-identifying
information; and

 • conducting privacy impact assessments for new systems, practices and data matching

proposals.

Custodians are required, under section 66(2),to enter into an agreement with an “Information
Manager” for the provision of various information technology services. An Information
Manager is a type of affiliate that provides information processing, storing, retrieving or
disposing services, data transformation or information management or information technology
functions.

Once an agreement with the Information Manager, is in place, the custodian may disclose
health information to that affiliate and the information may then be used or disclosed for the
purposes authorized in the agreement.

See section 5.3.2 in Chapter 5 of this Publication for further discussion on agreements with
“Information Managers” and Chapter 11 for more guidance on Records and Information
Management, Privacy and Security.

 9.6

ESTABLISHING OR ADOPTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

Each custodian must have or adopt policies and procedures that facilitate the administration
of the Act and the regulations. Custodians must also provide the Minister or Department, on
request, with a copy of such policies and procedures (section 63). Policies and procedures of
custodians should cover all aspects of administering the Act but are particularly important in
the area of ensuring the confidentiality of health information in their custody or under their
control and the privacy of the individuals who are the subjects of that health information.

The policies and practices set out in this Publication could form the basis of what is adopted by
a custodian. Larger custodian organizations have substantial policies and procedures in place
covering the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health information. These should be
periodically reviewed and adjusted as needed to comply with any changes in the Act. Regulated
health professionals may be guided by standards for health records or for the disclosure of
health information published by their regulatory bodies.

For example, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta has policies on
Physicians’ Office Medical Records, and the College
http://www.cpsa.ab.ca/publicationsresources/attachments_other/hia_booklet.pdf
and the Alberta Medical Association have a publication Health Information Act: Making it
Work, a guide for medical office staff. http://www.albertadoctors.org/

CHAPTER NINE – Administration of the Act

Some sector-specific information on the management of health records has been referred to in
Chapter 11 of this Publication.

Whenever a custodian makes a major change to its policies, the custodian must prepare a
privacy impact assessment to ensure that the changes do not introduce any new risks to the
privacy of health information (section 64(1)).

 9.7

MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE

When the Act requires that a notice or any other document be given to a person (such as in
sections 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15), section 103 states that it must be given:

 • by sending it to that person by prepaid mail to the last known address of that person;
 • by serving it personally on the individual;
 • by substitutional service if so authorized by the Commissioner (e.g., by double registered

mail to the individual’s last known address); or

 • by means of a machine or device that electronically transmits a copy of a document,

picture or other printed material by means of a telecommunications system
(e.g., fax machine).

 9.8

LIABILITIES, SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES

 9.8.1

IMMUNITY FROM SUIT

If custodians act in good faith, the Act protects them from legal action that may be taken
by an individual who feels that his or her health information was not collected, used or
disclosed appropriately.

Section 105 states that no action lies and no proceeding may be brought against the Crown, a
custodian or any person acting for or under the direction of a custodian, for damages resulting
from anything done or not done by that person in good faith while carrying out duties and
exercising powers under the Act. This includes any failure to do something where a person has
discretionary authority to do something but does not do it.

The discretionary exceptions in section 11 allow a custodian to exercise discretion in refusing
an individual’s access to all or part of his or her own health information. If an individual
alleges that he or she suffered damage as a result of a custodian refusing access to the
individual’s own health information under one of the discretionary exceptions in the Act, the
custodian would not face any legal consequences, if the refusal was done in good faith.

CHAPTER NINE – Administration of the Act

 9.8.2

PROTECTION OF EMPLOYEE

Section 106(1) provides protection to “whistleblowers” who disclose confidential health
information to the Commissioner under section 83. Under section 83, if an affiliate believes
that a custodian or other person is collecting, using or disclosing health information in
contravention of the Act, the affiliate may disclose that information to the Commissioner. The
Commissioner must investigate and review the disclosure, and must not reveal the identity of
the affiliate or the person to the custodian.

Section 106(1) protects an affiliate who makes such a disclosure to the Commissioner (blows
the whistle) from any action that may negatively affect the affiliate’s status, either by the
custodian or by someone acting on behalf of the custodian (section 106(1)(a)).

A custodian or person acting on behalf of a custodian also cannot take any action against an
affiliate who properly discloses information in accordance with the Act (e.g., in response to a
request for access under Part 2 (section 106(1)(b)).

In order to take advantage of this protection under the Act, affiliates must have acted in good
faith in disclosing information to the Commissioner.

A person who contravenes section 106(1) is guilty of an offence and is liable to a fine of not
more than $10,000 (section 106(2)).

 9.8.3  OFFENCES AND PENALTIES

Section 107 requires custodians and affiliates to cooperate with the Information and Privacy
Commissioner or another person conducting the duties of the Commissioner under the Act.

No Custodian or Affiliate May Knowingly:

 • alter, falsify or conceal any record, or direct another person to do so, with the intent to

evade a request for access to the record; or

 • destroy any record subject to the Act, or direct another person to do so, with the intent to

evade a request for access to the record.

No Person May Knowingly:

 • collect, use, disclose or create health information in contravention of the Act;
 • gain or attempt to gain access to health information in contravention of the Act;
 • make a false statement to, or mislead or attempt to mislead, the Commissioner or another
person performing the duties, powers or functions of the Commissioner or other person
under the Act;

 • obstruct the Commissioner or another person in the performance of the duties, powers or

functions of the Commissioner or other person under the Act:

 • fail to comply with an order made by the Commissioner under section 80 or by an

adjudicator under section 101. These are the orders made by the Commissioner or an
adjudicator on completing an inquiry, to dispose of the issues.

CHAPTER NINE – Administration of the Act

The order–making powers in those sections cover such matters as requiring a custodian to
grant access to all or part of a record; requiring a custodian to refuse access to all or part of
a record; confirming a decision of a custodian; requiring a person to stop collecting, using,
disclosing or creating health information in contravention of the Act; or requiring a person
to destroy health information collected or created in contravention of the Act.

 • use individually identifying health information to market any service for a commercial

purpose or to solicit money unless the individual who is the subject of the health
information has specifically consented to its use for that purpose.

No Researcher May Knowingly:

 • breach the terms and conditions of a research agreement entered into with a custodian

under section 54.

No Information Manager May Knowingly:

 • breach the terms and conditions of an information management agreement entered into

with a custodian under section 66.

No Person Intending to Use Non-Identifying Health Information for Data
Matching May:

 • fail to comply with section 32(2). This section requires the person to notify the

Commissioner of an intention to use non-identifying health information for data matching
purposes before performing the data matching.
An offence under this section may result either from a review requested by an applicant or
other individual under section 73; an investigation under section 84(a); or a disclosure to
the Commissioner under section 83 regarding a possible failure to comply with the rules in
the Act about collecting, using or disclosing health information.

Fines
Any person who contravenes section 107, except subsection (5.1), is guilty of an offence and
liable to a fine of not more than $50,000. Any person who contravenes section 107(5.1) is
guilty of an offence and liable

 • in the case of an individual, a fine of not less than $2000 and not more than $10,000, and
 • in the case of any other person , to a fine of not less than $200,000 and not more than

$500,000 (section 107(6)).

However, anyone who uses prescribed health information in contravention of section 56.4 is
guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of not more than $100,000 (section 107(6.2)).

A prosecution under the Act may be commenced within 2 years after the commission of the
alleged offence, but not afterwards.

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

 10.2

APPOINTMENT

The Commissioner is an Officer of the Legislature and is independent from government.

The Lieutenant Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Legislative Assembly,
appoints the Information and Privacy Commissioner to carry out the duties and functions set
out in the FOIP Act (section 45 of the FOIP Act). The Information and Privacy Commissioner is
also the Commissioner responsible to carry out the duties and functions set out in Part 7 of the
Health Information Act.

The Commissioner is appointed for a term of five years and is eligible for reappointment
(section 46 of the FOIP Act). The Commissioner may not be a Member of the Legislative
Assembly (section 45 of the FOIP Act). The Commissioner may resign, but may be removed or
suspended from office only for cause or incapacity (section 47 of the FOIP Act). This means
that the Commissioner may not be removed by arbitrary or capricious action, but only for some
reason affecting or concerning the ability or fitness of the Commissioner to perform the duties
of the office.

The Lieutenant Governor in Council may designate a judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench of
Alberta to act as an adjudicator:

 • when an investigation or review involves a custodian and the Commissioner was a former

member, employee or administrator of that custodian; or

 • where, in the Commissioner’s opinion, the Commissioner has a conflict of interest in a

review or investigation (section 96(1)).

The adjudicator has the same powers as the Commissioner in disposing of an investigation or
review (section 97).

Oath of Office
Under section 102(1), before beginning to perform his or her duties, the Commissioner must
take an oath to faithfully and impartially perform the duties of Commissioner under the Act
and not to disclose any information received by the Office except as provided for in the Act.
This oath is administered by the Speaker or Clerk of the Legislative Assembly.

Any person employed or engaged by the Office of the Commissioner must, before beginning
to perform their duties, also take a similar oath, as administered by the Commissioner
(section 102(2)).

 10.3  MANDATE AND GENERAL POWERS

Part 4 of the FOIP Act establishes the position of Information and Privacy Commissioner and
a supporting office. The Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner was established
in 1995. The Information and Privacy Commissioner is the Commissioner responsible under
the Health Information Act to ensure that custodians are complying with the letter and spirit of
that Act.

The general powers of the Commissioner are listed in section 84 of the Act.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

The Commissioner has general responsibility for monitoring how the legislation is administered
to ensure that its purposes are achieved. Specifically, he or she may:

 • conduct investigations to ensure compliance with any provision of the Act or compliance
with rules relating to the destruction of records in accordance with rules set out the Act or
any other enactment of Alberta (section 84)(a));

 • make an order regarding duties imposed by the Act such as granting or refusing access

to a record or reconsidering a decision, administrative matters such as extensions of time
and payment of fees, and the correction, collection, use, disclosure, creation or destruction
of health information as described in section 80(2)and (3). Such an order can be made
whether or not a review is requested (section 84(b));

 • inform the public about the Act (section 84(c));
 • receive comments from the public about the administration of the Act (section 84(d));
 • engage in or commission a study into anything affecting the achievement of the purposes

of the Act (section 84(e));

 • comment on the implications for access to health information or for protection of health

information of privacy impact assessments submitted to the Commissioner (section 84(f));

 • comment on the implications for protection of health information of using or disclosing

health information for data matching (section 84(g));

 • bring to the attention of a custodian any failure by a custodian to assist applicants under

section 10 (section 84(i)); and

 • give advice and recommendations of general application to a custodian regarding the rights
and obligations of custodians (section 84(h)). The Commissioner may use this power to
suggest improvement in the way a custodian deals with requests. This power will likely
only be used when there is evidence of poor administration, such as inadequate training
or failure to locate records; where there is wanton disregard for the provisions of the Act;
or where there are systemic problems, such as regular delays, improper interpretation of
exceptions or complaints about breaches of protection for health information.

Further, without limiting the general powers in section 84, the Commissioner may investigate
and attempt to resolve complaints that:

 • a duty imposed by section 10 (duty to assist applicants) has not been performed (section

85(a));

 • an extension of time for responding to a request is not in accordance with section 15 (time

extensions) (section 85(b));

 • a fee charged under the Act is inappropriate (section 85(c));
 • a correction of health information requested under section 13 has been refused without

justification (section 85(d)); or

 • health information has been collected, used, disclosed or created by a custodian in

contravention of the Act (section 85(e)).

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

The Commissioner has sole jurisdiction to investigate matters of access to health information
and the protection of health information that are governed by the Act. The Act specifically
prohibits the Ombudsman from investigating any matter within the jurisdiction of the
Commissioner unless the Commissioner agrees (section 94).

An order issued by the Commissioner is final (section 81). However, the Courts have inherent
and constitutional jurisdiction to review and determine whether the Commissioner has acted
within the authority given to the Office under the Act. This is known as the common law
principle of judicial review.

As an independent Officer of the Legislature, the Commissioner reports annually to the Speaker
of the Legislative Assembly describing the work of the Commissioner’s Office and such other
matters relating to the protection of health information that the Commissioner considers
appropriate (section 95(1)).

Further information, including copies of brochures, news releases, orders, investigation reports
and annual reports, is available at the web site of the Office of the Information and Privacy
Commissioner, at http://www.oipc.ab.ca.

 10.4  MONITORING ROLE

A number, but not all, of the powers of the Commissioner are discussed below.

The Commissioner may investigate the administration of the Act by custodians. The
Commissioner may also audit the practices of custodians in the areas of access to health
information and protection of health information.

In the area of access to health information, the Commissioner may, for example:
 • examine a custodian’s compliance with the time limits imposed by the Act;
 • investigate allegations that records are being destroyed to avoid producing them in

response to a request under the Act; or

 • review the decision of the custodian to refuse a request for a fee waiver, if requested to do

so by the applicant (sections 67((4) and (5)).

In the area of protection of privacy of health information, the Commissioner may, for example:

 • review the collection of health information by a custodian to ensure it has the legal

authority to collect the information (section 18) or is complying with the rules for indirect
collection (section 22(2));

 • review the records disposition practices of a custodian to ensure that it is retaining health

information as required by the Act;

 • review privacy impact assessments as required under sections 46, 70, 71 and 72 of the Act;
 • audit a custodian’s fair information practices within a program or health information

system to ensure compliance with the Act; or

 • investigate the application of new information technology to ensure that protection of

health information is being adequately addressed.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

Only authorized custodians may access Alberta Netcare. In order to be eligible to become an
authorized custodian the custodian must complete a privacy impact assessment which must be
submitted to the Commissioner for review.

The Commissioner may also examine and comment on legislation and program activities
in terms of any implications for access to health information and the protection of health
information.

Examples of such legislation and program activities include:

 • the amendment of a statute or by‑law to include provisions for introducing personal

identifiers, or to allow release of health information. The Commissioner could examine a
custodian’s reasons for including such amendments and comment on their relationship to
the provisions and intent of the Health Information Act; and

 • the enhancement of service delivery through implementation of a “smart card” using

health information for a variety of purposes.

The Commissioner might advise the custodian as to the need for a Privacy Impact Assessment
for the project. By commenting on and informing the public about the implications of
legislative and other proposals of custodians the Commissioner can help them to comply with
the spirit of open government and access and protection of health information rights and to be
accountable for their actions.

The Commissioner may publish Research Ethics Board (REB) approval letters in the interest of
openness and accountability. (Section 50.1)

The Commissioner may review automated information systems to ensure that they comply with
the Act.

The Commissioner also has the mandate to conduct or commission research into any issue
affecting the way in which the purposes of the Act are being achieved.

The Commissioner might hire a consultant to research the implications of employee
drug‑testing by custodians or the appropriate pricing of information made available without a
request under the Act.

The Commissioner’s role in dealing with reviews and complaints from persons not satisfied
with the handling of a request for access to or correction of health information is discussed in
section 10.13 of this chapter.

 10.5

PROVISION OF ADVICE

The Commissioner may provide a custodian with advice and recommendations on matters
respecting the rights or obligations of custodians under the Act (section 84(h)). Further, a
custodian may ask the Commissioner to give advice and recommendations on any matter
respecting any rights or duties under the Act (section 86(1)).

Some examples of advice that may be given under section 86 have been provided earlier in
this chapter.

Health and Wellness

277

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

The Commissioner may include advice or recommendations to a custodian in an order or an
investigation report (section 86(2)).

A custodian might seek advice from the Commissioner on general procedures or matters of
interpretation relating to an access request pursuant to Part 2 of the Act (Individual’s Right
to access Individual’s Health Information), or on how to appropriately apply the health
information protection provisions of Parts 3 to 6 of the Act (Collection, Use and Disclosure of
Health Information and Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information).
The advice will normally be sought through a letter from a custodian to the Commissioner.
Advice given in response to a request from a custodian must be of a general nature and not
anticipate or relate to a specific case. It can include recommendations on the administration
and application of the Act generally or more particularly to a certain custodian.

Section 86(2) provides that the Commissioner may respond to a custodian in writing with
advice and recommendations that:

 • state the material facts either expressly or by incorporating facts stated by the custodian;
 • are based on these facts; and
 • are based on any other considerations that the Commissioner considers appropriate.

 10.6

DISCLOSURE TO THE COMMISSIONER

The Commissioner must investigate and review any disclosure made to him or her by an
affiliate of a custodian of any information that an affiliate is required to keep confidential and
that the affiliate, acting in good faith, believes is being collected, used or disclosed in violation
of the Act (sections 83(1) and (2)).

The Commissioner must not disclose the identity of the affiliate to any person without the
affiliate’s consent (section 83(3)).

In carrying out an investigation and review under this provision, the Commissioner has the
powers of mediation, investigation, inquiry and order making described in section 83(5), as
well as the protection provided by section 83(4).

 10.7

POWERS TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS OR INQUIRIES

The Commissioner has all the powers, privileges and immunities of a commissioner under the
Public Inquiries Act (section 88(1)) when conducting an investigation under section 84(a) or
an inquiry under section 77, or when giving advice and recommendations under section 86
of the Act. These powers, privileges and immunities include the power to compel witnesses to
attend and answer questions at an inquiry, to compel records to be produced, to hold a person
in contempt and to obtain assistance from law enforcement officers.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

In addition, the Commissioner may exchange information with an extra‑provincial
commissioner and enter into information sharing and other agreements with extra‑provincial
commissioners for the purpose of coordinating activities and handling complaints involving
two or more jurisdictions (section 84 (1)(j)). “Extra‑provincial commissioner” means a person
who, in respect of Canada, or in respect of another province or territory of Canada has duties,
powers and functions similar to those of the Commissioner (section 84(2)).

 10.8

ACCESS TO INFORMATION

The Commissioner may require any record to be produced and may examine any information
in a record, whether or not the record is subject to the provisions of the Act (section 88(2)).

A custodian must produce any record or copy of a record requested by the Commissioner under
section 88(1) or (2) within 10 days (section 88(3)). This must be done regardless of any other
enactment of Alberta but not if a federal enactment, such as the Young Offenders Act (Canada),
prohibits disclosure (see OIPC Order 96-015).
http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/ACF19D.pdf

Records must be produced despite any privilege of the law of evidence that might otherwise
apply (section 88(3)). This requirement applies to records that the custodian believes to be
excluded from the coverage of the Act (see OIPC Practice Note No. 4, Section 4 – Exclusions
from the Act). (http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/PN4.pdf)

In Order H2008‑004, the Information and Privacy Commissioner concluded that section 88 of
the HIA did not provide him with the authority to compel a hospital to produce a record of a
quality review completed by the hospital for the purpose of determining the application of the
HIA to the record in the context of an access request.

If a custodian is required to produce a record and it is not practicable to make a copy of it, the
custodian may request that the Commissioner examine the original at the site of the custodian
(section 88(4)).

The Commissioner must return all records or copies of records to the custodian after
completing a review or investigating a complaint (section 88(5)).

 10.9

AUTHORIZING CUSTODIANS TO DISREGARD REQUESTS

A custodian may, under section 87 of the Act, request the Commissioner to authorize the
custodian to disregard requests from an applicant. This applies to both requests for access to
information and requests for correction or amendment of health information. A custodian must
present facts in support of its request. The Commissioner then makes a decision. A custodian
may be allowed to disregard a request if it is:

 • repetitious or systematic in nature, and processing the request would unreasonably

interfere with the operations of the custodian, or amount to an abuse of the right to make
requests; or

 • frivolous or vexatious.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

See section 2.4.9 and 2.4.10 of Chapter 2 of this Publication for more detail on Dealing with
Repetitious or Systematic Requests, including explanations for “repetitious”, “systematic”,
“unreasonable interference with operations of custodian”, “abuse of the right of access” and
“frivolous or vexatious”.

When a custodian asks for authorization to disregard a request, the processing time of that
request stops (section 87(2)) and

 • if the Commissioner authorizes the custodian to disregard the request, the processing

time ends;

 • if the Commissioner does not authorize the custodian to disregard the request, the
processing time clock resumes once the custodian is advised of the Commissioner’s
decision.

Asking for authorization to disregard requests should be rare. Custodians should ensure that
they have fully discharged their duty to assist applicants in a full and forthright manner and
have a strong case before seeking permission from the Commissioner to disregard requests
from one or more applicants.

 10.10  STATEMENTS PROVIDED TO THE COMMISSIONER

A statement made or an answer given by a person during an investigation or inquiry by the
Commissioner is inadmissible in evidence in court or in any other proceeding, except:

 • in a prosecution for perjury in respect of sworn testimony;
 • in a prosecution for an offence under the Act; or
 • in an application for judicial review or an appeal from a decision of that review

(section 89(1)).

These conditions also apply to evidence from proceedings conducted before the Commissioner
(section 89(2)).

Anything said, any information supplied or any record produced by a person during an
investigation or inquiry by the Commissioner is privileged. The rules that apply are those for a
proceeding before a court (section 90).

Section 91 of the Act places restrictions on the disclosure of information by the Commissioner
and the staff of the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner. They must not
disclose any information they obtain in the performance of their duties, with the following
exceptions:

 • disclosure of information that is necessary for the conduct of an investigation under the
Act or to establish the grounds for findings and recommendations made under the Act
(section 91(2));

 • disclosure to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General information relating to the

commission of an offence under an enactment of Alberta or Canada, if the Commissioner
believes there is evidence of an offence (section 91(4)); and

280

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

 • disclosure of information in the course of a prosecution for perjury or for an offence under
the Act, or in an application for judicial review or an appeal arising from that application
(section 91(5)).

When conducting an investigation or inquiry and when writing a report, the Commissioner
and the staff of the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner must not disclose any
information a custodian would be required or authorized to refuse to disclose. They must also
ensure that they do not disclose the fact that information exists where, in the refusal to provide
access, the custodian did not indicate whether the information exists (section 91(3)).

 10.11  PROTECTION FROM LIABILITY

The Commissioner and his or her staff are not liable for anything they do in good faith in
the exercise of their duties, powers or functions under Part 7 of the Act (The Commissioner)
(section 92).

As long as the Commissioner and his or her staff act honestly and with the intention of
complying with the Act, no action can be brought against them.

 10.12  DELEGATION OF THE COMMISSIONER’S POWERS

Section 93(1) provides that the Commissioner may delegate, in writing, to any other person
any duty, power or function of the Commissioner under the Act. The only exception to this
provision is that the Commissioner cannot delegate the power to delegate.

This allows the Commissioner to delegate powers to the Assistant Commissioner, to delegate
the power to examine law enforcement information and Cabinet documents, to authorize
custodians to disregard requests and to hold inquiries and issue orders on completion of
those inquiries.

 10.13  REVIEWS AND INVESTIGATIONS

Reviews
Section 73 of the Act provides individuals who have made a request for access to or correction
to or amendment of their own health information under Part 2 of the Act with the right to ask
the Commissioner to review any decision, act or failure to act by a custodian (section 73(1).

An individual who believes that his or her health information has been collected, used, or
disclosed in contravention of the Act may also ask the Commissioner to review the matter
(section 73(2).

Section 73(3) enables a custodian to ask the Commissioner to review the refusal of another
custodian to disclose health information pursuant to section 47(2).

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

The right to an impartial review of decisions or actions of a custodian is fundamental to
guaranteeing access to health information and protection of health information. The review
mechanism ensures that these rights are interpreted consistently among custodians and the
purposes of the Act are achieved. The orders, which summarize the reviews, issues, reasons,
and findings of the Commissioner, also provide guidance to custodians regarding the proper
interpretation of the Act.

A review by the Commissioner of the decision of a custodian is intended to be an avenue
of last resort. In most cases, an individual will be satisfied that the custodian has acted
responsibly and any outstanding issues can be settled between the custodian and the person
concerned. Even in cases where the person asks the Commissioner to review a decision, issues
can often be settled through mediation and an inquiry may not be necessary.

Certain matters that may be the subject of a request for review can also be grounds for a
complaint to the Commissioner under section 85 of the Act.

These are matters relating to:

 • the custodian’s duty to assist the applicant as required in section 10;
 • a decision to extend the time limit for responding to a request is not in accordance with

section 15;

 • a fee charged under section 67;
 • a refusal to make a correction to health information as requested under section 13(1); and
 • the collection, use, disclosure or creation of health information in contravention of the Act.

Requesting a Review
Section 74 of the Act sets out the process for requesting a review. A Flowchart of the Review
Process is provided in Figure 10 at the end of this chapter. The Office of the Information and
Privacy Commissioner provides a Request for Review Form for this purpose.

A copy of the form is included in Appendix 1 of this Publication.

Applications for a review can be made on this form or by letter, but in all cases must be in
writing (section 74(1)).

Section 104 establishes classes of individuals who may act for deceased persons, incompetent
persons, minors, formal patients under the Adult Guardianship and Trusteeship Act and any
other individuals in exercising this right under the Act.

A person must deliver a request for a review to the Commissioner within 60 days of receiving
notification of a custodian’s decision or a longer time when allowed by the Commissioner
(section 74(2)).

Failure by a custodian to respond in time to a request for access to a record is treated as a
decision to refuse access (deemed refusal) (section 74(3)).

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

Preparation for a Review
A custodian must be able to show that it has properly fulfilled its duties under the Act. It
should document the reasons for each decision relating to the withholding of records or parts
of records and should ensure that the circumstances surrounding the request support each
action it takes.

To reduce the need for review of decisions, custodians should provide applicants with clear
explanations of their decisions, the provision(s) of the Act that apply and the reasons why they
are applicable in the particular instance. These explanations provide a basis for discussion
of the decision and may help the custodian and the person to settle any outstanding issues
without recourse to the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner. This point is
discussed in OIPC Practice Note No. 2, ‘Informing the Applicant of Grounds for Refusal’.
http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/PN2.pdf

Review Process
The Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner has developed procedures for
conducting reviews and public inquiries and these are available from that office.

OIPC Practice Note No. 5, ‘Preparing Records and Submissions for Inquiries’ (http://www.
oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/PN5.pdf) should also be carefully read. The Act has enabling
provisions and some requirements governing the review process.

Upon receiving a request for review, the Commissioner must provide a copy of the request to
the custodian and to any other person the Commissioner believes is affected by the request
(section 75(1)(a)).

The Commissioner must also provide a summary of review procedures and an anticipated date
for a decision regarding the review to the person who asked for the review, to the custodian
and to any other person affected by the request (section 75(1)(b)).

The Commissioner may sever any information in the request that he/she considers appropriate
before providing copies as stated above (section 75(2)). This is necessary because applicants
may include health information as a part of their request for review, and it may not be
appropriate to disclose this to the custodian or to other persons.

The staff of the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner, the custodian and the
applicant will jointly review the request to determine whether the concerns raised in it can be
addressed through mediation.

The Commissioner will also ask the custodian to submit copies of the following
documentation, where applicable:

 • the request for access to information under Part 2 of the Act;
 • notice of the custodian’s decision;
 • any correspondence related to the request, issue or decision;
 • an index of the relevant records and exceptions relied upon;

© 2006-2011  Government of Alberta
Health and Wellness

283

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

 • severed and unsevered copies of the records; and, where applicable,
 • the custodian’s policies and procedures related to its management and protection of

health information under Parts 3 to 6 of the Act (Collection, Use and Disclosure of Health
Information and Duties and Powers of Custodians Relating to Health Information).

The custodian may initially be more familiar with the issues involved than the Office of the
Information and Privacy Commissioner. If the custodian has any information concerning
affected persons who should be notified of the review, it should inform the Office as soon as
possible.

The custodian should also make known any relevant issues, considerations or factors
that affected the making of the particular decision. The Commissioner will have a better
understanding of the custodian’s position if it can demonstrate that it made every effort to meet
an individual’s needs and to resolve outstanding issues.

Mediation
Section 76 provides that the Commissioner may authorize a mediator to investigate and try to
settle any matter that is the subject of a request for a review. In most cases, the Commissioner
will instruct a Portfolio or Compliance Officer to proceed in this way. The mediator does
not impose a settlement. Rather, mediation is intended to help the custodian and the person
requesting a review to arrive at a settlement before a formal inquiry is initiated.

Inquiry
If a mediator is not appointed or the matter is not resolved with the help of a mediator, the
Commissioner normally conducts an inquiry (section 77(1)).

In the course of the inquiry, the Commissioner will decide all questions of law and fact.

The Commissioner’s powers in conducting inquiries are provided in sections 77 and 88 of
the Act.

The Commissioner has broad discretion to determine how an inquiry will be conducted. It
may be conducted in private (section 77(2)) and the Commissioner may decide whether
representations are to be made orally or in writing (section 77(4)).

No party has a right to be present during another party’s The person who asked for the
review, representatives of the custodian concerned and any person given a copy of the
request for review are entitled to make representations to the Commissioner during the
inquiry (section 77(3)). These persons may choose to be represented by counsel or an agent
(section 77(5)).

representations, to have access to or to comment on representations made by another person
during the inquiry process (section 77(3)).

In the case of a refusal of access, the Commissioner has the right and duty to view all records
that have been withheld from disclosure in whole or in part. This right pertains regardless of
the exception that the custodian has used or the fact that the custodian believes the records are
excluded from the scope of the Act.

284

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

The Commissioner may require the records to be produced within 10 days (section 88(3)).
The Commissioner must return such records to the custodian upon completion of the review
(section 88(5)).

The custodian may require the Commissioner to examine an original record at the site at
which it is being held, if it is not practical to make a copy (section 88(4)). This could occur,
for example, when a record is too fragile to copy or the copying process would damage the
record. Custodians should avoid, as much as possible, requiring on‑site examination of records
since it will place an additional administrative burden on their own and the Commissioner’s
operations.

The Commissioner may compel witnesses to attend an inquiry and to answer questions. The
Commissioner has all the powers of a Commissioner provided under the Public Inquiries Act
(section 88(1)). These powers include the power to hold a person in contempt and to obtain
the assistance of law enforcement officers to compel attendance at an inquiry or to compel
records to be produced.

Refusal to Conduct Inquiry
Over time, issues raised in requests for review may replicate issues already dealt with by the
Commissioner. If the Commissioner believes that the subject matter of a request has already
been dealt with in an order or an investigation report, the Commissioner may refuse to conduct
an inquiry (section 78).

Time Limits for Review
Normally, the Commissioner’s inquiry must be completed within 90 days after receipt of the
request for review (section 77(6)). This time limit encompasses all elements of the review
process, including mediation and any formal inquiry.

However, the Commissioner may notify all parties to a review that he or she is extending the
period for the review and establish a date for the completion of the review (section 77(6)). The
intent of the Act is to ensure that an independent review of decisions can take place, so even if
the process is not completed within the extended time limit, the Commissioner has the power
to complete the inquiry (see OIPC Order 99-011).
(http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/99-011.pdf).

Burden of Proof
Section 79 establishes where the burden of proof lies in various situations relating to access to
records. Normally, the burden of proof rests with the custodian refusing access to all or part of
a record (section 79).

This means that under normal circumstances the custodian must prove, on the balance of
probabilities, that particular information may be excepted from release under the Act or
excluded from its scope.

Careful documentation of the reasons for refusing the request will form the central arguments
that will meet the burden of proof.

285

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

A custodian also has the burden of proof in cases where an applicant has requested a review
of fees charged (see OIPC Order 99-014). This is because the custodian has all the information
about the assessment and calculation of fees.

Commissioner’s Orders
Upon completion of an inquiry, section 80(1) of the Act requires the Commissioner to make
an order. If the inquiry concerns a refusal to grant access to all or part of a record, the
Commissioner may order one of the following under section 80(2):
 • require the custodian to give access to all or part of the record;
 • confirm the decision of the custodian or require the custodian to reconsider a decision to

refuse access; or

 • require the custodian to refuse access to part or all of the record requested.

When the Commissioner finds that a refusal to grant access is in compliance with the Act, and
the custodian has properly exercised his or her discretion, the Commissioner may only confirm
the decision of the custodian or request that the custodian reconsider the decision based on its
exercise of discretion.

The Commissioner can only require the custodian to reconsider a decision to refuse access, not
a decision to grant access (see OIPC Order 98-001).
(http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/98-001.pdf)

If the inquiry concerns any other matter, such as the matters discussed in section 85, the
Commissioner may make an order requiring compliance with the provisions of the Act. Under
section 80(3), the Commissioner may:

 • require a duty imposed by the Act or regulations to be performed;
 • confirm or reduce the extension of a time limit under section 15;
 • confirm or reduce a fee required to be paid or to order a refund, including where a time

limit is not met;

 • confirm a decision not to correct or amend health information or specify how health

information is to be corrected or amended;

 • require a person to stop collecting, using, disclosing or creating health information in

contravention of the Act; or

 • require a person to destroy health information collected or created in contravention of

the Act.

Section 80(4) provides that the Commissioner may attach any terms or conditions to an order.
A copy of the order is given to the person who asked for the review, the custodian concerned,
any person given a copy of the request for review, and the Minister responsible for the
administration of the Act (section 80(5)).

A custodian that has received an order from the Commissioner must comply with the order
no earlier than 45 days after the order, and no later than 50 days after the order (section 82(1)
and (2)). This is to allow the parties time to apply for judicial review.

286

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

If an application for judicial review is made, the Commissioner’s order is stayed until the Court
has dealt with the application (section 82(4)).

There is no appeal from an order made by the Commissioner (section 81) except a limited
appeal through judicial review (see section 10.15 of this Chapter).

It is an offence to fail to comply with an order made by the Commissioner under section 80
(section 107(2)(e)). The Commissioner may choose to file a copy of an order with the clerk of
the Court of Queen’s Bench and, after filing, the order is enforceable as a judgment or order of
that Court (section 80(6)).

Investigations
Section 84 of the Act enables the Commissioner to monitor compliance with the Act and
carry out investigations into how the Act is being administered to ensure that its purposes are
achieved. Section 85, without limiting these more general powers, enables the Commissioner to
investigate and attempt to resolve complaints that:

 • a duty imposed by section 10 (duty to assist has not been performed);
 • an extension of time for responding to a request is not in accordance with section 15;
 • a fee charged under the Act is not appropriate;
 • a correction or amendment of health information requested under section 13 has been

refused without justification; or

 • health information has been collected, used, disclosed or created by a custodian in

contravention of the Act.

The main difference between an investigation and a review is that an investigation may not be
a result of a request for access to health information under Part 2 of the Act. A complaint that
does not arise from an access request is most likely to arise in cases involving allegations of
improper collection, use, disclosure or creation of health information.

When an investigation is held into an alleged breach of protection of health information
(section 85(e)), a Portfolio or Compliance Officer from the Office of the Information and
Privacy Commissioner is assigned to investigate the matter. When the investigation is
complete, an investigation report is prepared and sent to both parties. It includes the Portfolio
or Compliance Officer’s findings and recommendations. The complainant is asked whether
the report satisfies his or her concerns and the custodian is asked to inform the Portfolio or
Compliance Officer how it will comply with the recommendations.

If the complainant is satisfied with the report’s finding and recommendations, and the
custodian accepts the recommendations, the Portfolio or Compliance Officer forwards the
report to the Commissioner and advises that the complaint has been resolved.

If the complainant is not satisfied with the findings and recommendations, he or she can
request that the matter proceed to inquiry in accordance with section 73(2).

In this case, the report of the Portfolio or Compliance Officer is not forwarded to the
Commissioner and is not publicly released. Evidence collected during the investigation is not
normally forwarded to the Commissioner for the inquiry.

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

For further details on the process of dealing with the investigation of complaints see OIPC
Practice Note No. 7, ‘Privacy Complaints – Investigations and Inquiries’.
(http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/PN7.pdf)

Custodians are always informed by the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner
as to whether an issue is subject to a review (section 74) or an investigation (section 84(a)).
The preparation and response to an investigation will be very similar to those outlined for the
review process described above see OIPC Practice Note No. 3, ‘Complaints about Public Bodies
–Reviews versus Investigations’). (http://www.oipc.ab.ca/ims/client/upload/PN3.pdf)

Time Limits on Complaints
When an investigation arises from a Health Information Act request, the applicant must deliver
the complaint to the Commissioner within 60 days of receiving notification of the custodian’s
decision (section 74(2)(a)).

A longer time may be allowed by the Commissioner (section 74(2)(b)) When allowing a delay,
the Commissioner will consider all relevant circumstances.

The Act does not specify a time limit for filing complaints about a breach of health information
privacy, since these do not, for the most part, arise from a request for access to health
information under Part 2 of the Act. They tend to stem from a complainant’s belief that there
has been improper collection, use, disclosure or creation of health information.

Privacy Investigations and Audits
The Commissioner can take an active role in investigating compliance with Parts 3 to 6
(Collection, Use and Disclosure of Health Information and Powers and Duties of Custodians
Relating to Health Information). An investigation can be undertaken as a result of a complaint
that health information is not being collected, used, disclosed or created in accordance with the
provisions of the Act.

As well, the Commissioner may decide to conduct an audit of the management and protection
of the privacy of health information collected, used or disclosed in a program of a custodian.
The Commissioner’s practice is to make all Investigation Reports and Health Information
Privacy Audit Reports public.

Refer to Chapter 11 of this Publication for a checklist to help custodians determine whether
they currently comply with the requirements of Parts 3 to 6 of the Act.

The Checklist also serves as a guide for remedial measures that may be necessary to adequately
protect the health information in the custody or under their control of custodians.

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

 10.14  ADJUDICATOR PROCESS

Section 96 provides for the appointment of an adjudicator. This occurs in situations when the
Commissioner is not in a position to conduct an investigation or review because there would
be an apprehension of bias. This can occur when the Commissioner has been a member,
employee or administrator of a custodian in a capacity directly related to the matter under
investigation or review, or when the matter relates to the Office of the Information and Privacy
Commissioner or any other Office of the Legislature of which he or she is the head.

The Commissioner makes the determination that he or she has a conflict of interest
(section 96(1)).

An adjudicator cannot review an order of the Commissioner (section 96(2)).

An applicant or custodian seeking a review under section 73 of the Act when these
circumstances exist may request that an adjudicator be appointed to conduct the review
(section 98).

The request must be in writing to the Minister responsible for the Act (section 99(1)). The
request must be delivered to the Minister within 60 days of the person receiving notice of the
decision to be reviewed (section 99(2)(a)). The adjudicator may decide that a longer period
should be allowed (section 99(2)(b)).

Upon receipt of the request, the Minister must facilitate the appointment of an adjudicator,
give the request to him or her and also give a copy to the Commissioner and to any other
person who is affected by the request (section 100(a) and (b)). The Minister must also
provide a summary of the review procedures to the person that asked for the review and to the
Commissioner and to any other person who is affected by the request (section 100(c)).

The Minister will confirm with the Commissioner that a conflict exists and will verify that the
request is valid. Documentation needed to allow the Minister and Cabinet to review the request
will be compiled. Alberta Justice is responsible for requesting the Chief Justice of Alberta to
nominate a judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench to act as adjudicator.

A submission is made to Cabinet to authorize the Lieutenant Governor in Council to designate
the judge to act as an adjudicator. The Minister must provide a copy of the applicant’s request
for review, together with a summary of the review procedures that will govern the process,
to the adjudicator, the Commissioner and any other person affected by the request. This is
currently the process followed for the appointment of an adjudicator under the FOIP Act.

An adjudicator has the same powers and duties as the Commissioner and can dispose of a
matter in the same way (sections 97 and 101(1) and (2)). A copy of the adjudicator’s order
must be given to the Commissioner (section 101(3)). An order made by an adjudicator is
final (section 101(6)). The duty to comply with an order and the time periods for applying for
judicial review in section 82 apply to an order of an adjudicator (section 101(5)).

The Government of Alberta may pay the adjudicator and the adjudicator’s expenses for
retaining persons to assist the adjudicator (section 96(4)).

CHAPTER TEN – Commissioner’s Powers and Duties

 10.15

JUDICIAL REVIEW

The Commissioner has exclusive jurisdiction to conduct a review and investigate complaints
against a custodian under the Act. Courts do not have the power to issue orders under the Act.

However, a person may apply to the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta to exercise its
inherent jurisdiction to review any action or failure to act on the part of the Commissioner
(or an adjudicator where one has been appointed). It may also review the decisions of the
Commissioner for an error of law on the face of the record, jurisdictional error or breach of
natural justice (fairness).

Application for judicial review of a decision of the Commissioner must be made not later
than 45 days after the party applying for judicial review is given a copy of the decision
(section 82(3)) unless the court extends this period (section 82(5)).

When an application is made for judicial review, the Commissioner’s order is stayed
(section 82(4)).

The Court has the power to compel the Commissioner to do something or to refrain from doing
something and the power to send a matter back to the Commissioner for reconsideration.

A judicial review is not an appeal of the Commissioner’s decision. The Court cannot substitute
its own decision for that of the Commissioner. The Commissioner is the final arbiter of
questions of fact but is always subject to the overriding jurisdiction of the Court to ensure that
the Commissioner acts within his or her authority.

Records and Information Management,
Privacy and Security

 11.1

OVERVIEW

This Chapter will cover:

 • the purposes for records and information management;
 • the powers of the Information and Privacy Commissioner to conduct investigations to

ensure compliance with rules relating to the destruction of health records;

 • records issues relating to access requests;
 • records and information management principles;
 • records and information management policy components;
 • how to review compliance with Parts 3 to 6 of the Act (Collection, Use and Disclosure of

Health Information and Powers and Duties of Custodians Relating to Health Information);

 • how to review forms used in the collection of health information to ensure they meet the

collection and notification requirements of the Act;

 • how to conduct an assessment of threats and risks to the security of health information;

and

 • how to develop a health information security policy that supports the duty to protect the

privacy of individuals and the confidentiality of their health information.

 11.2

RECORDS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

To meet their obligations under the Health Information Act, custodians need to have in place
effective records and information management practices. This Chapter is intended to help
custodians understand how these practices assist in the effective administration of the Act.

Records and information management is generally carried out to:
 • support policy formation and managerial decision‑making;
 • improve client services and support better performance of business activities;
 • support consistency, continuity and productivity in operations, administration and

management;

 • protect the interests of the organization and the rights of clients, the public and employees;
 • provide protection and evidentiary support in litigation;

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

 • facilitate research and development activities; and
 • enable the organization to meet legislative and regulatory requirements.

Custodians may have statutory responsibilities regarding retention and disposition of records in
addition to their responsibilities under the HIA.

For example, the Department is subject to the Records Management Regulation (AR 57/95).
Section 15 of the Operation of Approved Hospitals Regulation under the Hospitals Act
establishes retention and disposition practices for approved hospitals. The College of
Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta published a policy - available on the College’s website
at www.cpsa.ab.ca - on “Physicians’ Office Medical Records” which included guidelines on
retention and disposition of medical records.

For the Department and other custodians, section 3(c) of the Health Information Act authorizes
the transfer, storage or destruction of health records if it is done in accordance with an
enactment of Alberta or Canada. The scheduling and disposition of health records must
take into account the importance of an authorization process that ensures the custodian can
meet its financial, legal and ethical obligations, including its obligations under the Health
Information Act.

Custodians are required, under section 60(2), to maintain administrative, technical and
physical safeguards that include appropriate measures for the proper disposal of records to
prevent any reasonably anticipated unauthorized use or disclosure of the health information or
unauthorized access to the health information following its disposal.

 11.2.1  POWERS OF THE COMMISSIONER

Section 84(1) authorizes the Information and Privacy Commissioner to monitor the general
administration of the Act to ensure that its purposes are achieved. This includes conducting
investigations to ensure compliance with rules relating to the destruction of health records set
out in any other enactment of Alberta.

Custodians should expect their records and information management practices to be under
scrutiny during reviews, investigations and health information privacy audits conducted by
the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner. This is especially the case when an
applicant requests a review of the adequacy of a search for information or records.

 11.2.2  RECORDS ISSUES RELATING TO ACCESS REQUESTS

The right of access to an individual’s own health information in health records, which is
provided in Part 2 of the Act, is intended to make custodians more open and accountable to
individuals regarding their own health information. Inadequate record keeping can contribute
to poor accountability to clients and patients.

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

In the case of right of access requests, a custodian may find that poor records management can
cause it to violate the Act.

This may lead to:

 • challenges to the credibility and reputation of the custodian;
 • costly use of resources to defend past actions rather than the use of resources to facilitate

the provision of health services; and

 • exposure of the custodian as being negligent or ineffective in the discharge of its

responsibilities through orders and reports of the Information and Privacy Commissioner
and commentary from applicants, the media and interested members of the public.

Some common issues are outlined below.

Ability to Find Records
The right of access provisions of Part 2 of the Health Information Act assume an ability on
the part of custodians to identify, locate and produce records in response to requests. The
search process is greatly facilitated if a retrieval system is in place that allows staff processing
an access request to search for an identifiable individual’s health information and find all
locations where that information may be located.

The failure to capture health records in effective record‑keeping systems may result in difficult
and time‑consuming searches for records, as well as uncertainty that all records relevant to a
right of access request have been located. This is particularly an issue when no records can
be found related to an individual, although it appears that a custodian should have created
and maintained records about that individual and there is no evidence that the record was
destroyed in an authorized manner.

An effective records management system should allow retrieval of semi‑active as well as active
holdings. It should also allow for retrieval of records in a storage facility, such as the Alberta
Records Centre (for the Department and for its agencies, boards and commissions under
Schedule 1 of the FOIP Regulation).

In addition, the records management system should provide some ability to alert an applicant
to the fact that his or her health records may have been transferred to the custodian’s archives,
if they have one.

Applicants may challenge the adequacy of a search for records by a custodian. It will be easier
to demonstrate thoroughness if there is an established record‑keeping system.

Custodians also need to be able to show that the search has been conducted in a systematic
and reasonable manner and that all records reasonably related to an applicant’s request have
been located.

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

Issues relating to the adequacy of a custodian’s search have been addressed in numerous OIPC
decisions. In the OIPC Order 96-022, the Commissioner established a basic test that must be
met in order for a public body to carry out an adequate search under FOIP:.

 • a public body will meet its duty to assist an applicant where it makes every reasonable

effort to search for the records requested and it informs the applicant in a timely way what
it has done.

In the OIPC Order H2005-003, the Commissioner determined that the same basic test could
be applied to cases arising under the HIA. The Commissioner further commented that the
assessment of adequacy of a search is a question of fact to be determined on a case‑by‑case
basis. The standard for the search is not perfection but rather what is “reasonable” in the
circumstances. Refer also to OIPC Order H2006-003. (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

For example in OIPC Order 99-021, a department relied upon a previous search done in
response to an earlier request from the same applicant and the opinion of an employee that
no responsive records had been found at that time. The Commissioner stated that a search that
relies on the memory of an employee is not in compliance with the FOIP Act.

Standard of Documentation
A custodian should have a standard of documentation. This requires clear direction as to
how affiliates will document health records. Some examples of standard documentation
practices are:

 • writing legibly and accurately;
 • recording concisely only the necessary information being as objective as possible and

describing observations;

 • recording events chronologically;
 • dating all entries and signing or initialing them;
 • recording the information immediately or as soon as possible;
 • doing all documentation in ink, not pencil;
 • correcting errors and omissions openly and honestly, including dating and initialing

changes made;

 • ensuring that warning/caution indicators on health records clearly stand out;
 • supporting entries made to an electronic health record by codes indicating the identity of

the person who inputted the entry and including the date and time of the entry; and

 • following routine practices and procedures when recording health information.

Affiliates should be held accountable for documenting their activities and observations
regarding the provision of health services. As well, there is a need in the modern electronic
work environment to ensure that information technology systems have the capability to build
in version control where this is required. This enables custodians to retrieve the authoritative
versions of certain documents upon which actions or decisions are based.

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

There is also need for clear direction on what health records the custodian considers are
transitory in nature.

For example, rough notes, messages, and routine documentation, which have only short-term
value, may be disposed of regularly at the discretion of an affiliate in accordance with a policy or
guideline on transitory records.

In the absence of such direction on transitory records, the Commissioner could require
a custodian to produce other evidence at an inquiry that a health record that has been
destroyed was appropriately destroyed as a transitory record. (see OIPC Order 99-009)
(http://www.oipc.ab.ca/)

Transitory records are discussed in greater detail in section 11.2.4 of this Chapter.

Finally, standards of documentation should clearly indicate that the official health records of
the custodian cannot be altered or destroyed without authorization.

Alteration or destruction of health records is a very serious matter, especially when done to
evade a right of access request, and could lead to penalties or sanctions. See section 9.8.3 of
Chapter 9 of this Publication for information on the offence provisions of the Act.

Controls over Disposition
Section 60(2) states that safeguards for the protection of health information must include
appropriate measures for the proper disposal of records to prevent any reasonably anticipated
unauthorized use or disclosure of health information or unauthorized access to health
information following its disposal.

Section 108(1)(o) enables the Lieutenant Governor in council to make regulations respecting
the retention, disposal and archival storage for records for the purposes of section 60.

The Act does not prohibit the transfer, storage or destruction of a record in accordance with an
enactment of Alberta or Canada (section 3(c)).

The requirements in section 60(2) and section 3(c) as well as cost‑effective business practices
dictate that a custodian have a systematic process for disposing of health records as they
become inactive and are no longer needed for such things as providing health services, for
health system management, for research or to protect the organization’s interests in the event
of litigation.

This process, known as records scheduling and disposition, has several advantages from the
perspective of complying with the Act.

First, it provides control over the disposal or destruction of records, so that custodians know
what was destroyed, and when. It also sets out what records of enduring value are transferred
to archives. Establishment of retention and disposition schedules – and compliance with them
– allows custodians to set accurate limits to searches for records.

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

Second, a schedule provides an official approval process for the disposition of health records
after a fixed time period, including the destruction of transitory records, based on patient
and organization needs. It provides evidence for the applicant, and for the Commissioner if
necessary, that records have been appropriately disposed of by custodian.

In orders following reviews under the FOIP Act, the Commissioner has emphasized the
importance of rules relating to the destruction of records, and he has noted that it is within the
purview of the Commissioner to ensure compliance with such rules. (see OIPC Order 98-011)
(http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

Finally, a schedule allows for the movement of health records through the system. This reduces
the need for custodians to tie up resources in the maintenance of older records, which may be
very labour‑intensive to locate and handle.

The Health Professions Act has been amended to include provisions relating to abandoned (or
“orphan”) records. The amendments are awaiting proclamation. Once in force, the provisions
will require a council of a college of a regulated health profession to adopt standards of practice
that require each regulated member to make arrangements and put plans in place to ensure
that the member’s patient records are not abandoned, as that term is defined in the regulations.
They will also require a college to ensure that any abandoned patient records of a member are
secured and managed in accordance with the regulations. The Court of Queen’s Bench will be
given order‑making power to (a) direct the sheriff of any judicial district in Alberta to seize,
remove and place in the custody of a trustee abandoned patient records, or property containing
abandoned patient records, and (b) authorize the sheriff to enter on land or premises or open
any receptacle if there is reason to believe that abandoned patient records may be found on the
land or premises or in the receptacle. Regulation‑making powers concerning abandoned records
will also come into force.

Older records that need to be permanently preserved to protect the interests of a custodian or
the interests of patients (e.g., recipients of tainted blood products or breast implants) may be
stored in the Provincial Archives of Alberta or in any other archival facility that is subject to
the Health Information Act or to the FOIP Act (section 38). The reason for placing records in
an archival facility is to permanently preserve the records or to allow for historical research.
Before placing records containing individually identifying health information in an archives, the
custodian must form the opinion that the information has enduring value.

See section 5.2.4 of Chapter 5 of this Publication for a discussion of the duty to protect health
information and the requirements under section 60(2) of the Act and section 8.11 of Chapter 8
of this Publication for a discussion of disclosure of health information to an archives.

Right of access requests can then be dealt with by these organizations, which are usually well
oriented to dealing with requests for records.

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

In summary, the lack of a systematic records scheduling and disposition system can mean that:

 • older records are retained far longer than needed;
 • there is random destruction of records, which can be embarrassing for the custodian or

which may expose the custodian to risk of litigation;

 • there is no official authority for the legitimate disposition of health records that are of no

further use, including transitory records;

 • resources may be wasted looking for records that no longer exist; and
 • materials that should be permanently preserved may be lost.

Ability to Routinely Disclose Records outside the Act
A custodian needs:

 • to have effective control over the health records and information which it creates and

collects; and

 • to be knowledgeable about such records and information.

This is required to make effective decisions about which records could be released on a routine
basis, provided this is done in compliance with the Act.

 11.2.3  RECORDS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES

The following principles underpin the effective management of health records.

The Management of Information is Planned
An organization’s business planning processes require both strategic and operational records
and information management planning.

All Records are Included
Management practices should apply to all records as defined in section 1(1)(t) of the Act,
including electronic records.

Electronic records include:

 • electronic documents, such as word processed documents, spreadsheets, e‑mail, web

pages, graphics, digital photographs, and scanned images;
 • electronic data, such as information stored in databases; and
 • back‑up tapes.

Electronic records include information in all media and in all locations.

For example, electronic records may be stored on networks, local hard drives and portable hard
drives, as well as in storage media such as floppy disks, CD-ROM disks, optical disks, and tape.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

Information is an Important Resource of the Organization
An essential principle for the management of health records is that information is managed as
a resource or asset of the whole organization and not as the property of affiliates or branches of
a custodian.

A Life Cycle Management Approach is Adopted
Sound principles for the management of health records are based on the life cycle of
information. Management activities within the life cycle encompass:

 • the planning of information systems, including appropriate controls over the collection,

creation or compilation of health information;

 • the establishment of practices and procedures governing the organization, distribution,
retrieval, use, accessibility and transmission of health records and for their storage,
maintenance and protection;

 • the provision for routine access to certain health information, as appropriate; and
 • the regulation of the disposition of all health records.

Accountability is Assigned
Given the close relationship between the Health Information Act and the effective management
of health records, there should be an assignment of accountability for the management of
health records by an affiliate with sufficient experience and knowledge to carry out this
responsibility appropriately.

 11.2.4  RECORDS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICY COMPONENTS

Policy and guidelines should govern the management of health records within a custodian’s
organization. These should be developed with the administration of the Act in mind and
include appropriate references to information access and protection of privacy requirements in
the policy statements as well as the procedures, practices and standards.

Beyond principles, certain basic requirements or policies should be set out relating to both the
management of health records and the custodian’s responsibilities under the Act.

The following components should be included in policies for the management of health
records.

Life Cycle Management
The policy should require the custodian to plan, direct, organize and control health records
throughout their life cycle, regardless of the form or medium in which the information is held.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

The Establishment and Maintenance of Records Systems
Another component of a records and information management policy is for a custodian to
establish a records system. A records system, which may be computerized or manual, is an
information system which captures, maintains and provides access to health records over time.

A records system should be controlled by a current, comprehensive and structured
identification or subject classification system. Such a classification system provides an effective
means of organizing, locating and retrieving all health records in the custody or under the
control of the custodian.

The records system should serve as a locator system for all holdings of health records. It should
also indicate which department, branch or affiliate has responsibility for particular types of
health records. In addition, it should support the application of privacy protection measures.

Guide to Information Holdings
An important component of a records system is the records inventory or guide to information
holdings, which provides descriptions of the health records in the system.

The guide to information holdings is a critical tool for the overall management of health
records. It should support access to information both internally, for the custodian’s authorized
purposes and externally, where such sharing is permitted by the Act.

The guide to information holdings may also serve as the basis for establishing records retention
and disposition schedules.

The Creation and Generation of Records
The policy should establish effective controls over the creation, maintenance and use of all
health records through the establishment of a documentation standard. This standard should
indicate what health records need to be created and maintained.

For example, records required for the provision of health services, or for legal, fiscal, audit,
administrative or operational purposes should be maintained in a records system.

The standard of documentation should be understood and followed by all affiliates of a
custodian.

A Guide for Transitory Records
The policy may enable affiliates to destroy transitory records. A transitory record is a record
that does not have long‑term value. Transitory records contain health information that is not
required to meet legal, financial or other obligations, and has no historical value.

A full definition of transitory records that has been developed for provincial public bodies
(subject to the FOIP Act) is provided in the following publication: Official & Transitory Records:
A Guide for Alberta Government Employees, produced by the Information Management
Branch, Service Alberta. (http://www.im.gov.ab.ca)

301

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

This definition would apply only to records held by provincial public bodies who are also
custodians under the Health Information Act. Other custodians may develop and approve their
own definitions, but must be prepared to defend deviations from recognized standards before
the Information and Privacy Commissioner.

Certain types of recorded information are generally managed as transitory records:

 • information of short‑term value (e.g., notes kept to prepare official minutes of a meeting);
 • duplicate documents;
 • draft documents and working materials that are used to create a master record or that do

not document changes in decisions;
 • personal messages and announcements;
 • e‑mail that does not document a decision or transaction on behalf of the custodian.

Custodians should have an internal e‑mail policy that aids affiliates in deciding when
electronic mail information should be retained in records systems; and

 • voice mail that does not document a decision or transaction on behalf of the custodian.

The Organization, Storage and Protection of Recorded Health Information
An information management policy establishing a records classification system will provide
a framework for the organization and storage of health records that facilitates the location
and retrieval of those records or information in the records. The policy should also address
information security and the protection of privacy of health information, both for the business
of the custodian and for purposes of the Act.

The custodian should have standards in place relating to the organization, control, storage and
protection of health information and health records, including electronic records.

Special Rules for the Organization and Management of Electronic Records
Electronic records are subject to the Health Information Act and should be managed as part
of any program for the management of recorded information. Ideally, in an electronic records
system, processes should be in place to ensure that, where necessary:

 • individual records are uniquely identified;
 • contextual data, or “metadata,” relating to the specific record or transaction is preserved
(this may consist of, for example, date, subject, names of correspondents or participants);

 • records can be authenticated;
 • there is version control;
 • records are classified and indexed for retrieval;
 • there are access controls;
 • there are controls over the alteration of records, including audit trails on use; and
 • there are processes in place to permit the disposal of obsolete records under approved

processes and retention and disposition schedules.

An electronic records system should address the effective management, retention and disposal
of e‑mail.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

If there is not an adequate electronic record‑keeping system, the policy should require
records to be printed off and managed as part of the record‑keeping system applied to hard
copy records.

Section 6 of the Electroinc Health Record Regulation requires custodians to ensure their EHRIS
have capacity to create and maintain logs containing the following information:
 • user identification and application identification associated with an access;
 • name of user and application that performs an access;
 • role or job functions of user who performs an access;
 • date of an access;
 • time of an access;
 • actions performed by a user during an access, including, without limitation, creating,

viewing, editing and deleting information;

 • name of facility or organization at which an access is performed;
 • display screen number or reference;
 • personal health number of the individual in respect of whom an access is performed;
 • name of the individual in respect of whom an access is performed;
 • any other information required by the Minister.

The Planning of Electronic Information Systems
The application of new information technology within custodians often has an impact on
existing record‑keeping activities.

A records and information management policy may establish a mandatory process for
introducing the records system requirements into the planning and design of electronic
applications that will collect, create or generate health information used by the custodian.

Health information should be managed to promote individual access and, if individually
identifying health information has been transformed to become non‑identifying, to allow public
access, where this is appropriate.

Privacy protection measures must be considered in the design and functional specifications
for information systems that are used to collect, generate, manipulate, and disclose
health information.

The particular requirements for protection of privacy of health information are discussed in
Chapters 5, 6, 7 and 8 of this Publication.

The Scheduling and Disposition of Recorded Health Information
Control over the disposition of health records is an important aspect of records management
that is critical to the administration of the Act. When responding to a right of access request
under Part 2 of the Act, it is necessary to know whether records have been destroyed and if so,
whether this has been done in an authorized manner.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

It is equally important to dispose of health records under conditions that protect the privacy
rights of the individual (section 60(2)).

A records retention and disposition schedule is a custodian’s legal authority regarding how long
health information of various types must be kept and how it is to be disposed of (section 3(c))
either by destruction or archival preservation.

Each custodian should establish a scheduling process that governs the retention and final
disposition of all the health information in its custody or under its control in accordance with
any current regulations or authorities under which it acts or in future, under the regulation
respecting the retention, disposition and archival storage of records for the purposes of
section 60.

For example, currently, under the Records Management Regulation, the Alberta Records
Management Committee approves records retention and disposition schedules for the
Department and its affiliated agencies, boards and commissions. The schedules provide
authority to transfer records selected for archival preservation to the Provincial Archives of
Alberta.

The scheduling process for provincial public bodies (under the FOIP Act) is discussed in the
Information Management Branch, Service Alberta, publication Developing Records Retention
& Disposition Schedules. (http://www.im.gov.ab.ca)

For other custodians, authority to approve the transfer or destruction of health records will
be derived from their governing body (e.g., a regional health authority or provincial health
board, etc.) or from a health professional body.

For example, under the Operation of Approved Hospitals Regulation, made under the
Hospitals Act, diagnostic and treatment service records must be retained by the hospital for the
following periods:

•	 a	period	of	10	years	from	the	date	of	discharge	from	hospital;

•	 in	the	case	of	a	patient	being	a	minor,	for	a	period	of	at	least	2	years	following	the	date	on

which	the	patient	reached	the	age	of	18	years;	and

•	 diagnostic	and	treatment	service	records	may	be	retained	by	the	hospital	for	an	additional

period as may be considered necessary by the board.

Also, under the above Regulation, diagnostic and treatment service records:

•	 may	be	microfilmed	on	discharge	of	the	patient	from	the	hospital	and	the	original	records

may	then	be	destroyed	after	one	year	from	the	date	of	discharge	of	the	patient;	and

•	 x-ray	films	may	be	destroyed	after	5	years	from	the	date	of	discharge	of	the	patient.

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

Another example of retention and disposition schedules can be found in the College of
Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta policy on “Physicians’ Office Medical Records”. In that
policy, the recommended retention schedules for x-ray films, mammography films and x-ray
reports are set out. (http://www.cpsa.ab.ca)

In addition, the Council of the College recommends that physicians retain their office medical
records for a minimum period of ten years, or in the case of minor patients, until two years
after the age of 18 or for 10 years, whichever is longer. This includes retention by electronic
means or storage of hard copy, the entire interpretive report and a segment of continuous
physiologic recordings, whether abnormal or not, sufficient to support the interpretation made.

Following these periods of availability, records may be disposed of by secure and confidential
shredding, burning or erasing. Commercial shredding services are available.

Articles 73 to 79 of the Pharmacy and Drug Act Standards for Operating Licensed Pharmacies
establish retention practices for pharmacists.

For example, prescription records must be kept for 2 years after the last change to a
prescription.

Custodians must pay strict attention to disposal processes for health records. Disposal
processes should be governed by established and well‑understood procedures and be carried
out in accordance with any future regulation under the Health Information Act.

Sensitive health information intended for destruction but left in an insecure condition may be
exposed to unauthorized access and, possibly, use.

Examples include disposal of garbage bags that rip open and release documents containing
health information, and disposal of health information in an unprotected recycling container.

OIPC Investigation Report H2001-IR-009: Records containing health information related to
treatment and care provided by a physiotherapy clinic was discovered amongst torn garbage
in an open field. These records were drafts that should have been shredded as they were not
part of patient charts. Although there was an internal process in place for the disposal of these
records, the clinic did not have any written policy or procedures regarding the disposal of
records. As an affiliate of a health region, the clinic was obligated under the HIA to ensure that
appropriate measures are taken to prevent unauthorized access to patient health information
following its disposal. The OIPC found the clinic’s process for disposing of draft records as
reasonable but recommended that the process be incorporated into a written policy and
procedure and staff be trained accordingly. (http://www.oipc.ab.ca)

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

Pulping or shredding is the best way of disposing of paper and other hard copy media. This
should be done in a facility or by a mobile shredding service that can ensure complete and
secure destruction.

Used office and computer equipment poses a special risk. At a minimum, computer hard drives
and diskettes need to be professionally wiped clean of data before they are disposed of or sold.

For surplus computers, the Department must:

 • remove data from hard drives and diskettes and verify that the data has been removed

prior to shipping to Surplus Sales. It must also verity that after wiping, no data is
accessible using disk analysis tools such as Norton’s Utilities Disk Editor;

 • remove external media such as tapes, CD’s diskettes and ZIP disks from computers prior to
shipping to Surplus Sales. If the media is to be destroyed, the Department must follow the
appropriate destruction procedures;

 • for disk wiping, use commercial or in‑house software that writes random characters

over the entire hard drive and is shown, using disk analysis tools, not to leave any trace
information;

 • remove and destroy hard drives that cannot be completely cleared of data; and
 • provide a certification of data removal report prior to shipping the computer to Surplus

Sales.

See the Service Alberta Technology Services Policy for Maintaining Security of Government
Data Stored on Electronic Data Storage Devices and the Security Policy for Disk Wiping
Surplus Computers.

For custodians who are also public bodies subject to the Records Management Regulation,
destruction of recorded information must take place in accordance with the records
management policies and procedures established by the Government of Alberta.

Records Management in Contracting
For programs and services contracted by custodians to other agencies, provision should
be made in policy for all contracts to require the contractor to create records that meet the
custodian’s requirements.

Contracts should also require the contractor to maintain health records according to standards
acceptable to the custodian for as long as required, to dispose of the records according to
standards acceptable to the custodian, or to return the records to the custodian, as appropriate.

When activities requiring the collection or handling of health information are contracted out,
the contract should set out the privacy protection and security obligations assumed by the
contractor (see Chapters 5, 6, 7 and 8 of this Publication).

 11.3

PRIVACY, INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY

Parts 3 to 6 of the Act establish the rules regarding the collection, use, disclosure, disposal
and protection of health information. The following sections of this Publication provide some
guidelines to help custodians:

 • review their information systems and practices to bring them into compliance with Parts
3 to 6 of the Act (Collection, Use and Disclosure of Health Information and Powers and
Duties of Custodians Relating to Health Information);

 • review forms used in the collection of health information to ensure that they meet the

collection and notification requirements of the Act;

 • conduct threat and risk assessments to identify potential threats to or vulnerabilities

affecting the security of health information and to assess the level of risk and the impact of
identified security breaches; and

 • develop a security policy that supports protection of health information privacy.

 11.3.1  REVIEWING COMPLIANCE WITH PARTS 3 TO 6 OF THE ACT

This section provides a checklist to assist custodians in reviewing their compliance with the
rules regarding the collection, use, disclosure, disposal and protection of health information
in their custody or under their control as set out in Parts 3, 4 and 5 of the Act as well their
duties and responsibilities under Part 6. This is the same checklist that is used in the technical
compliance portion of the privacy impact assessment process and can be used for both
automated and manual information systems.

The responses to the following questions/criteria will help a custodian determine whether
it is in general compliance with the requirements of Parts 3 to 6 of the Act for each of its
information systems or programs.

1.  Collection of Health Information (Sections 19 & 20)

 • Is individually identifying health information being collected?
 • What is the authority for the collection?
 • Is the collection expressly authorized by an enactment of Alberta or Canada? (s. 20(a))
 • Does the information relate directly to and is it necessary to carry out a section 27

purpose? (s.20(b))

 • Has only necessary health information been collected (on a need to know basis)? (s. 24)
 • Is the information being collected at the highest level of anonymity possible and in a

limited manner? (ss. 57 & 58)

2.  Collection of Personal Health Number (Section 21)

 • What authority requires individuals to provide their personal health number (PHN) (if this

needs to be collected)?

 • Is the person requiring provision of the PHN a custodian or a person authorized by

section 4 of the Health Information Act Regulation? (s.21(1))

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

3.  Manner of Collection of Health Information (Section 22)

 • Is individually identifying health information collected directly from the individuals it is

about? (s.22(1))

 • How will affected individuals be notified of the legal authority for and purpose(s) for the

collection as well as the contact information (s. 22(3))?

 • If individually identifying health information is being collected indirectly, what is the

authority for the indirect collection and what is the source?
 • What exception to direct collection applies under s. 22(2)?
 • Is the information flowing from another custodian or another system?
 • If there is a linkage to another database is it on a one time only or on an on‑going basis?

(See questions in #14 below on Data Matching)

 • Are there procedures in place to periodically review the need for the information

(e.g., 5 years or with a change in the program or service)?

4.  Use of Health Information (Sections 27 - 30)

 • Is individually identifying health information being used?
 • Have all the anticipated uses been identified and are they authorized uses under s. 27?
 • If the personal health number has been collected, is it only being used for the purpose for

which it was collected? (s. 30)

consents from the individuals to be contacted by the researcher? (s. 55)

 • If the disclosure for research purposes involves data matching of individually identifying

diagnostic, treatment and care information or individually identifying registration
information, have the provisions in ss. 49 to 56 been complied with (s. 72), including the
conducting of a privacy impact assessment? (ss. 64, 32(2), and 71)
Note that the definition of “health information” in Division 3 of the Act (Disclosure
for Research Purposes) refers to individually identifying diagnostic, treatment and care
information or individually identifying registration information, or both. Even though a
Research Ethics Board review may have been conducted under s. 50, the disclosure of
individually identifying health information for data matching for research purposes would
still require a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) to be conducted (section 72). However, the
portions of the assessment done by the REB related to security safeguards could be used
in the PIA.

 11.3.2  REVIEW OF FORMS

When individually identifying health information is collected directly from the individual that
it is about, section 22(3) of the Act requires that the individual be notified of the purpose for
which personal information is being collected from him or her, the specific legal authority
for the collection, and the title, business address and telephone number of someone who can
answer questions about the collection.

Forms are a major way of collecting personal information. For that reason, it is important to
bring forms (paper and electronic) into compliance with the provisions the Act.

In doing so, custodians will:

 • support the right of individuals to know what health information custodians collect about

them and how this information is used;

 • support the right of individuals to access information about themselves; and
 • help maintain confidence among individuals that custodians are protecting their personal

information from unauthorized collection, use and disclosure.

As indicated in Chapter 6 of this Publication, achieving compliance with the collection
requirements set out in sections 21 through 24 as well as with the duties of custodians
under sections 57, 58, 60, 61, and 64 of the Act requires a thorough review of a custodian’s
collection activities. Included in this should be a review of all forms to ensure that those used
to collect information directly from individuals meet the requirements of the Act and that any
unnecessary forms are eliminated.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

When there is a need to reprint or redesign forms, to facilitate notification, custodians may
print a supply of notifications (or privacy statements) covering:

 • the purpose for which the information is collected;
 • the legal authority for collection;
 • the uses to which the information will be put; and
 • the name, business address and telephone number of a person who can answer questions

about the collection.

These may be provided separately to individuals or attached to or contained in the forms being
provided to individuals.

In cases where some health information on a form is no longer collected (e.g., there is no need
to collect it), custodians should inform clients/patients that certain fields must not be filled out.
These instructions should be provided in writing, and affiliates should take steps to achieve
consistency in their approach to handling forms. In some instances, it may be possible to black
out fields that are no longer required.

A review of forms and other collection instruments may be combined with the review of
compliance with Parts 3 to 6 of the Act discussed in section 11.3.1 of this Chapter.

Notification
The notification may be printed on the collection form itself, on a separate or covering
document that explains the form and how to fill it out, or it may be given verbally. Oral
notification is practical when information is taken personally over the telephone, given by
touch‑tone telephone or taken during an interview.

When the notification is provided orally, care must be taken to provide the individual with
a copy of the privacy statement either at the office where collection takes place or with the
documentation sent to an individual to confirm collection of information over the telephone
or electronically.

An example of a collection notification is as follows:

“This personal information is being collected under the authority of (state name of act or program)
and will be used to (state known purposes). It is protected by the privacy provisions of the Health
Information Act. If you have any questions about the collection, contact (name, address, and
business telephone number of responsible affiliate)”. (See the Sample Collection Notice in
Appendix 1 of this Publication)

Optional Practices
There are a number of practices for the collection of health information through forms which
reflect good management of health information but are not mandatory under the Health
Information Act.

EXAMPLES OF OPTIONAL BEST PRACTICES INCLUDE:

•	 design	of	forms	to	ensure	that	the	individual	from	whom	the	information	is	collected	is	given	a

copy of the notification;

•	 design	of	forms	to	ensure	that	a	copy	of	the	notification	is	also	retained	by	the	custodian;

•	 detailed	notifications	where	appropriate	to	inform	the	individual	about	his	or	her	right	to	request
correction of inaccurate or incomplete information, the right to appeal refusals of corrections and
the role of the Information and Privacy Commissioner in reviewing such refusals;

•	 review	by	the	Health	Information	Coordinator	or	responsible	affiliate	of	all	new	forms	and
proposed revisions before finalization for printing, including review of privacy issues; and

•	 where	personal	information	is	collected	from	a	source	other	than	the	individual	the	information
is about (indirect collection), provisions to inform individuals generally that information about
them is being sought from a variety of specific sources. Such explanations should be included in
documentation or brochures given to individuals who are the subjects of the indirect collection.

Electronic Forms
There are a number of special factors that should be taken into consideration when
dealing with computer‑generated forms or when planning to move into an electronic forms
environment.

BEST PRACTICES INCLUDE:

•	 a	policy	and	accountability	structure	should	be	put	in	place	to	ensure	that	privacy	statements	are

included on electronic forms, which are often generated on a decentralized basis;

•	 when	software	for	creating	forms	is	under	consideration,	one	of	the	specifications	should	be	that
it permits the easy addition of collection notifications or privacy statements in ways that are
convenient and that effectively inform the individual filling out the electronic form of his or her
privacy rights;

•	 provision	should	be	made	for	authorization	of	indirect	collection	and	for	authorization	of

additional uses or disclosures of the information on electronic forms where this is permitted under
the Act, as well as for a signature or other verification of the identity of the individual providing
the authorization;

•	 a	hard	copy	of	the	form	should	be	provided	to	the	individual	the	information	is	about,	including

the notification of collection (privacy statement) on the form; and

•	 the	custodian	should	be	able	to	retain	a	copy	of	the	authorization	and	notification.

These practices establish an audit trail within electronic information collection for the
authorization of collection, the source of the information and the notification of collection and
use. If these practices are not used, some other audit practices should be in place.

 11.3.3  CONDUCTING A THREAT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

In order to determine the level of protection of health information that is needed to comply
with section 60 of the Act and section 8 of the Health Information Regulation, a threat and
risk assessment needs to be conducted for the health information held by the custodian as a
whole and also for the health information needed for each key function, program or service
within or provided by a custodian. This process should be flexible and ongoing with the ability
to identify new risks as they arise. Threats will change continuously so that current threats
will need to be re‑evaluated and potential or anticipated threats identified. Re‑assessment will
also be needed as the nature of health information in the custody or under the control of a
custodian changes or as new safeguards are developed.

Framework for a Threat and Risk Assessment
The components of a threat and risk assessment are as follows:

 • Determine what health information and other assets are to be protected;
 • Determine what threats there are to the privacy of individuals who are the subjects of
the health information in the custody or under the control of the custodian and to the
confidentiality of that health information;

 • Assess whether existing or proposed security measures or safeguards are adequate and

determine vulnerabilities; and

 • Identify what steps should be taken to manage the identified risks.

Determine What Health Information and other Assets are to be Protected
Health information in the custody or under the control of the custodian can be grouped
according to the function, process, program or service it supports. Within each group, the
information may have different requirements for its protection. As part of this determination,
the data items or information, software, staff (users, administrators, analysts), storage facilities,
storage media, system documentation, etc. should all be listed.

Determine the Potential Threats to the Security of Health Information
For each grouping of health information:

 • identify the potential agents or events that could place the asset or group of assets at risk

(e.g., theft, unauthorized access, viruses, power loss, etc.);

 • classify each agent or event by the type of threat;
 • determine how likely the event is to occur; and
 • identify the potential consequences and rate the impact of the events if they were to occur.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

Threats to the security of information include threats to its confidentiality, integrity and
availability. Common threats are:

 • disclosure of information – e.g., unauthorized verbal disclosure, leaving information

displayed on a monitor, electronic interception of information travelling over a transmission
line, such as a fax machine or cellular phone, faxing information to the wrong fax number,
unauthorized access to information stored on an affiliate’s home computer;

 • service interruption – e.g., power failure, labour dispute, denial of service attack on an

Internet server;

 • modification of data – e.g., malicious code, forgery, addition of data to a record;
 • accidental or deliberate loss of data – e.g., physical damage to hardware, willful destruction

of recorded information, information destroyed in a flood or fire;

 • removal of equipment – e.g., theft of a laptop or file containing health information, use
of information outside the custodian’s office (e.g., using the information on a home
computer), disposal of information at the custodian’s home;

 • misuse of information – e.g., transfer of or sale of health information in contravention of

the Health Information Act; and

 • information not being available – e.g., records that are misdirected or misfiled, or that

are destroyed in a manner that is not in accordance with approved records retention and
disposition schedules or policies.

Determine the likelihood (low, medium or high) of each or any of the above threats occurring.
Identify the potential consequences and rate the seriousness (less serious, serious or very
serious) of the events if they were to occur.

Assess Whether Existing or Proposed Security Measures or Safeguards
are Satisfactory
Based on the potential threats that have been identified and the likelihood and impact of the
events occurring that could place each group of health information at risk, assess the adequacy
of existing safeguards and current resources to protect against the potential threats.

This assessment involves listing the existing safeguards to protect against the potential event;
considering whether the information might still be vulnerable to the potential threat; and
rating the potential risk. A low risk potential will require some attention and consideration
for safeguard implementation; moderate risk potential requires attention and safeguard
implementation in the near future; and high risk potential requires immediate attention and
immediate safeguard implementation.

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

Identify the Steps to Take in Managing the Identified Risks
In considering potential vulnerability and risk, identify any additional safeguards recommended
to lower the risk to an acceptable level and describe those proposed measures or safeguards.

Different safeguards may provide different levels of protection. Selection of the most
appropriate safeguard will depend upon the availability of resources, and the acceptable level
of risk. Custodians can rate the projected risk if the proposed safeguard was to be put in place
as low, moderate or high. However, keep in mind that implementing the ‘high’ safeguards may
not be practical depending upon technical or physical limitations or upon time or financial
constraints.

This Framework for Conducting a Threat and Risk Assessment was adapted from the health
sector industry best practices including international security codes of practice and standards
such as the COACH Guidelines for the Protection of Health Information. (www.coachorg.com)

 11.3.4  DEVELOPING A SECURITY POLICY

Section 60(1) requires a custodian to take reasonable steps in accordance with the regulations
(see section 8 of the Health Information Regulation) to maintain administrative, technical and
physical safeguards that will:

 • protect the confidentiality of health information in its custody or under its control and the

privacy of the individuals who are the subjects of that information;

 • protect the confidentiality of health information that is to be stored or used in a jurisdiction

outside Alberta or that is to be disclosed by the custodian to a person in a jurisdiction
outside Alberta and the privacy of the individuals who are the subjects of that information;

 • protect against any reasonably anticipated:

–  threat or hazard to the security or integrity of the health information or of loss of the

health information, or

–  unauthorized use, disclosure or modification of the health information or unauthorized

access to the health information; and

 • otherwise ensure compliance with the Act by the custodian and its affiliates.

Section 60(2) says that the safeguards to be maintained must include appropriate measures for
the proper disposal of records to prevent any reasonably anticipated unauthorized use or dis‑
closure of the health information or unauthorized access to the health information following its
disposal.

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

As an important means of ensuring compliance with the duty to protect health information
under the Act, a custodian should establish a health information security policy, make its
affiliates aware of the policy and require them to adhere to it. The policy should set out the
usual practices and procedures of the custodian aimed at maintaining the administrative,
technical and physical safeguards deemed to be necessary from the threat and risk assessment
conducted by the custodian.

The following components for a health information security policy are adapted from the
Canada’s Health Informatics Association COACH Guidelines. (www.coachorg.com)

Authority
The policy should contain a statement of the authority or authorities under which it is being
issued and a direction from the senior officer of the custodian on its effective implementation.

Administrative and Organizational Security
This part of the policy will set the overall framework and should include:

 • having a written health information security policy;
 • specifying the responsibility of the person responsible for the policy;
 • specifying the purpose(s) of each information system operated by the custodian;
 • setting a schedule for review and audit activities, including responsibilities and threat and

risk analyses;

 • setting out the processes and procedures for patients to access their own health

information; and

 • establishing information system access records and setting out schedules and processes for

retention and disposal of such records.

Personnel Security
This part of the policy ensures that personnel are aware of security requirements and should
include:

 • recruitment policies, including the requirement for a signed and witnessed oath or pledge

of confidentiality and privacy;

 • training requirements for new and existing staff regarding the Health Information Act and

the confidentiality and privacy requirements;

 • mechanisms for determining each affiliate’s level of ‘need to know’ and procedures for

restricting that affiliate to an appropriate level of information access;

 • policies regarding appropriate separation of duties (e.g., affiliates providing health services

CHAPTER ELEVEN – Records and Information Management, Privacy and Security

Security in Contracting
This part of the policy relates to the protective arrangements applying to health information
in the custody of contractors but under the control of the custodian. This may include health
information that is collected, compiled, used, disclosed or disposed of by a contractor.

The policy should stipulate that its provisions apply to persons working under contract to a
custodian who are required to handle health information or have access to information systems
or facilities where such information is handled or stored. The extent of physical, technical and
personnel security requirements that a contractor will have to meet will have to be decided on
a contract‑by‑contract basis.

Overall, the information security policy needs to meet the requirements of the duty to protect
health information in section 60 of the Act and the requirements of section 8 of the Health
Information Regulation, dealing with security of health information.

OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER TWELVE

This Chapter will cover:

 • an introduction to paramountcy as it applies to the Health Information Act;
 • relationship to the FOIP Act;
 • confidentiality provisions in other statutes that are now governed by the Health

Information Act;

 • statutory provisions that prevail over the Health Information Act;
 • statutory provisions that maintain the status quo; and
 • housekeeping amendments.

The full text of the Health Information Act consequential amendments and the provisions of
each of the other acts that were amended consequentially are set out in the Appendix at the
end of this Chapter.

 12.2

INTRODUCTION TO PARAMOUNTCY AS IT APPLIES TO THE
HEALTH INFORMATION ACT

The issue of paramountcy arises in cases where there is a conflict between a provision of
the Health Information Act and a provision in other legislation. In these cases, the Health
Information Act is paramount over other legislation unless specific provision is made in the
Health Information Act, in the Health Information Regulation or in another act to make that
other act or regulation paramount over the Health Information Act.

Section 4 of the Health Information Act says that if a provision of that Act is inconsistent
or in conflict with a provision of another act or of a regulation, the provision in the Health
Information Act prevails unless another act, or a regulation under the Health Information Act
expressly provides that the other act or regulation, or a provision of it, prevails despite the
Health Information Act.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER TWELVE – Consequential Amendments

A conflict or inconsistency may occur when access to information is more restricted in another
act or regulation than it would be under the Health Information Act.

For example, section 75 of the Public Health Act will prevail over any enactment that is in
conflict or inconsistent with, including the Health information Act, except for the Alberta Bill of
Rights. A regulation under the Public Health Act prevails over any other by-law, rule, order or
regulation with which it conflicts.

A conflict or inconsistency may also occur when confidentiality provisions in the Health
Information Act are more restrictive than in other legislation.

A provision in the Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act (section 109(3)) that enables records
of hospital boards to be produced when they relate to court proceedings regarding a child,
prevails over the Health Information Act.

The authority to enact regulations under the Health Information Act to establish that other
legislation prevails or is paramount, is provided in section 108(1)(i). Under that section, the
Lieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations expressly providing that another act or a
regulation, or a provision of it, prevails despite the Health Information Act for the purposes of
section 4 of the Act.

Section 4 of the Health Information Regulation, states that section 4 of the Child, Youth and
Family Enhancement Act prevails over the Health Information Act. Under section 4 of the Child,
Youth and Family Enhancement Act, any person who believes, on reasonable and probable
grounds, that a child is in need of protective services, must report the matter to a director
designated under that Act. The reporting obligation exists even when the information upon
which the belief is founded is confidential and its disclosure would be prohibited under any
other statute.

The Health Information Act makes consequential amendments to other statutes. The
consequential amendments are found in sections 110 to 124 of the Health Information Act.

 12.3

RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FOIP ACT

Section 4(1)(u) to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. says that the
Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act does not apply to records in the custody
or under the control of a public body that is a custodian of health information as defined in the
Health Information Act. This effectively carves “health information” out of the FOIP Act.

Sections 15.1 and 37.1 have been added to the Freedom of Information and Protection of
Privacy Act. These provisions are ‘deeming’ provisions. This means that when an access
request or a request for correction or amendment of information is made under the Freedom
of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, the part of the request that relates to the health
information is deemed to be a request under the Health Information Act..

The above sections only apply if the custodian that receives the request is also a public body
under the FOIP Act (i.e., the Minister and Department, a regional health authority ).

 12.4

CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS IN OTHER STATUTES NOW GOVERNED BY
THE HEALTH INFORMATION ACT

HOSPITALS ACT
Section 24(1.1) of the Hospitals Act says that except as permitted or required under the
Hospitals Act, health information from hospital records or persons having access to them may
only be disclosed in accordance with the Health Information Act.

Section 24(18)(a) of the Hospitals Act says that the definition of “health information” is as
defined in the Health Information Act.

MENTAL HEALTH ACT
Section 17(1)(b.1) says that the definition of “health information” is as defined in the Health
Information Act.

Section 17(1.1) of the Mental Health Act says that except as permitted or required under the
Mental Health Act, health information from a diagnostic and treatment center or persons
having access to them may only be disclosed in accordance with the Health Information Act
(either under Part 2 (Individual’s Right to Access Individual’s Health Information) or Part 5
(Disclosure of Health Information)).

NURSING HOMES ACT
Section 20(4) says that section 20(2) of the Nursing Homes Act does not apply to health
information within the meaning of the Health Information Act.

Section 20(2) of the Nursing Homes Act was the general confidentiality provision that applied
to information in resident’s records. This amendment means that health information located in
residents’ records will be governed by the Health Information Act rather than by the Nursing
Homes Act.

STATUTORY PROVISIONS THAT PREVAIL OVER THE
HEALTH INFORMATION ACT

ALBERTA HEALTH CARE INSURANCE ACT
Section 22(1.1) of the Alberta Health Care Insurance Act establishes that subsections 22(6.1)
and 22(7) of the Alberta Health Care Insurance Act prevail over the Health Information Act
if there is an inconsistency or conflict between subsections 22(6.1) or 22(7) and the Health
Information Act.

CHILD, YOUTH AND FAMILY ENHANCEMENT ACT
Section 109(3) of the Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act maintains the paramountcy of
the Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act for records that are subpoenaed and otherwise
confidential under other legislation such as the Health Information Act and the Public Health
Act. Section 4 of the Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act prevails despite the Health
Information Act (Health Information Regulation, section 4).

EMERGENCY HEALTH SERVICES ACT
Section 40.1 of the Emergency Health Services Act states that ‑ notwithstanding the Health
Information Act and FOIP ‑ ambulance attendants may disclose certain individually identifying
health information to police.

PUBLIC HEALTH ACT
Section 75 in the Public Health Act, says that except for the Alberta Bill of Rights, the Public
Health Act prevails over any enactment that it conflicts with or is inconsistent with, including
the Health Information Act. This provision retains the paramountcy of the Public Health Act
over other legislation.

CROWN’S RIGHT OF RECOVERY ACT
Section 16(5) of the Crown’s Right of Recovery Act provides that if there is a conflict or
inconsistency between section 16 (Information relating to health services) and the Health
Information Act, section 16 prevails.

MENTAL HEALTH ACT
A regulation made under section 45(2)(b) of the Mental Health Act (i.e., the provisions of the
Patient Advocate regulation) prevails over the Health Information Act.

Alberta Electronic Health Record

 13.1

OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER 13

This Chapter will cover:

 • the Alberta Electronic Health Record (EHR) or “Alberta Netcare”;
 • the sharing and using of prescribed health information among authorized custodians via

Alberta Netcare;

 • the Electronic Health Record Data Stewardship Committee and the Alberta Netcare

Electronic Health Record Information Exchange Protocol;

 • how individuals may request access to their own health information in Alberta Netcare;
 • making prescribed health information accessible in Alberta Netcare; and
 • how an authorized custodian may consider the expressed wishes of an individual in the

context of Alberta Netcare.

 13.2  WHAT IS THE ALBERTA ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR)?

The exchange of health information is not a new practice. Paper‑based health records are often
transferred between practitioners for treatment and care purposes. The Alberta EHR or “Alberta
Netcare” allows for the exchange of information in an automated manner.

Alberta Netcare is a clinical health information network that links community physicians,
pharmacists, hospitals, home care and other authorized custodians across the province.

It is not a patient’s full health or medical record. Alberta Netcare does not provide access to the
full record of the health care information kept by a health care provider.

The Health Information Act (HIA) defines Alberta Netcare as “the integrated electronic health
information system established to provide shared access by authorized custodians to prescribed
health information in a secure environment as may be further defined or described in the
regulations” (section 56.1(a)).

The Alberta EHR has been developed by Alberta Health and Wellness (AHW) in cooperation
and partnership with Alberta’s health region, and many other partners including the health
professional colleges and associations.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN – Alberta Electronic Health Record

Alberta Netcare is an important tool for physicians, pharmacists and other health service
providers in Alberta. It improves patient care by providing up‑to‑date available information
immediately at the point of care, reducing delays in treatment and providing online decision
support and reference tools. Making basic patient information available to health service
providers supports better care decisions and improves patient safety. It also helps reduce the
possibility of medical errors, assists with compliance issues, and decreases the potential for
adverse drug reactions. Consistent with the HIA, Alberta Netcare is also a highly secure system
that protects patient privacy.

Today, many physicians, pharmacists and other health service providers are recording
information about their patients electronically, rather than in paper files. This information
may be stored in a local electronic medical record or in a clinical information system. Labs,
pharmacies, diagnostic services and community clinics are also capturing and storing
information electronically.

The Alberta EHR captures several key data elements from these clinical records for inclusion
in a patient’s provincial electronic health record. The information elements that are part of
Alberta Netcare include:

 • personal demographic information that helps to uniquely identify each patient;
 • prescribed dispensed drugs;
 • known allergies and intolerances;
 • immunizations;
 • laboratory test results;
 • diagnostic imaging reports; and
 • other medical reports.

The information available for access by an authorized custodian varies according to the
access permissions assigned to that provider. For example, administrative staff working
in a physician’s office will not have the same level of access as the physician since the
administrative staff does not have a need to know the same information as the physician who
is providing treatment and care.

Alberta Netcare also offers authorized custodians several decision support tools including:
 • drug‑to‑drug and drug‑to‑allergy interaction alerts to avoid prescriptions that conflict;
 • a database of all available drugs and their common dosages; and
 • links to information support such as Clinical Guidelines from the Alberta

Medical Association.

Contents of the EHR are maintained and updated in two ways:

 • Primarily, information is automatically accessed and captured from the existing electronic
data systems of pharmacies, labs, regional clinics and diagnostic services. This means that
this information is not re‑keyed or re‑entered by anyone, it is gathered from source systems.

 • Additionally, some information can be entered directly into a record by an

authorized custodian.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN – Alberta Electronic Health Record

 13.3

 Part 5.1 of HIA

Part 5.1 of the HIA addresses the Alberta Electronic Health Record. The purpose of Part 5.1 of
the HIA is to specifically enable the sharing and use of prescribed health information, through
Alberta Netcare, by authorized custodians (section 56.2).

The Act permits the creation of a regulation designating an information manager of the
Alberta EHR. “Information manager” is defined in the Act as a person or body that:

(a)  processes, stores, retrieves or disposes of health information,
(b)  in accordance with the regulations, strips, encodes or otherwise transforms
individually identifying health information to create non‑identifying health
information, or

(c)  provides information management or information technology services.

The Department, under the direction of the person in the named position, carries out these
activities in relation to the Alberta EHR.

The HIA EHR Regulation contains a provision to enable a person in a named position within
the Department to be designated the information manager of the Alberta EHR.

 13.4  MAKING PRESCRIBED INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE THROUGH

ALBERTA NETCARE

A health professional body, such as the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta or
the Alberta College of Pharmacists, may direct their members to make prescribed health
information that is in the custody or under the control of its members accessible through the
Alberta EHR. (section 56.3(1))

In certain circumstances, the Minister may determine that it is in the public interest to have
certain prescribed health information made accessible to authorized custodians through Alberta
Netcare. However, before directing members of a health professional body to make certain
information available, the Minister must:

 • Consult with the health professional body whose members will be making that

information available,

 • Prepare a privacy impact assessment that describes how making this health information
accessible may affect the privacy of the individual who is the subject of the information
and submit the privacy impact assessment to the Privacy Commissioner for review and
comment, and

 • Consider the comments of the Privacy Commissioner, if any, made in response to the

privacy impact assessment (sections 56.3(2), (3)).

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER THIRTEEN – Alberta Electronic Health Record

The process for making prescribed health information accessible through the Alberta EHR
enables health professional bodies and the Minister to ensure that the information available
through the Alberta EHR is pertinent and necessary to enhance point of care delivery to
Albertans by authorized custodians.

Members of the health professional body must make the prescribed health information
available in accordance with the written directions issued by their health professional body or
by the Minister (section 56.3(4)).

An authorized custodian may make prescribed health information in its custody or under
its control accessible to authorized custodians via the Alberta EHR in accordance with the
regulations (section 56.3(5)). An authorized custodian other than the member of a regulated
health professional body must, if the Minister requests in writing, make prescribed health
information available in its custody or under its control accessible to authorized custodians via
the Alberta EHR (section 56.3(6)).

Making prescribed health information accessible pursuant to these sections of the HIA does not
constitute a disclosure of that information. Furthermore, it does not require the consent of an
individual who is the subject of that information (section 56.3(7)).

 13.5

USE OF PRESCRIBED HEALTH INFORMATION BY AUTHORIZED
CUSTODIANS VIA ALBERTA NETCARE

Authorized custodian means a provincial health board; a regional health authority; Alberta
Health and Wellness; the Minister of Alberta Health and Wellness, and any other custodian
that meets the eligibility requirements of the regulations to be an authorized custodian
(section 56.1(b)).

Requirements for becoming an authorized custodian

Section 3 of the EHR Regulation provides the requirements that must be met for a custodian to
become an authorized custodian. Only authorized custodians may access Alberta Netcare. In
order to be eligible to become an authorized custodian:

 • A custodian’s health profession must have policies and procedures in place to ensure
custodians and their affiliates will comply with the Health Information Act (HIA);

 • The custodian’s health profession must have standards of practice about how to manage

information in records;

 • The custodian’s health profession must have standards that speak to managing electronic
records, including necessary technical requirements and potential implications for privacy
and security;

 • The custodian’s health profession must adopt minimum security standards for managing

electronic records, aligned with the Provincial Organization Readiness Assessment;

 • The custodian must complete a privacy impact assessment which must be submitted to the

OIPC for review;

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER THIRTEEN – Alberta Electronic Health Record

 • The custodian must meet any security requirements established by the Department;
 • The custodian must enter into an Information Manager Agreement with the Department;

and

 • The custodian must obtain approval for access to Alberta Netcare from the Department.

When the Department is considering whether or not to approve access to Alberta Netcare, it
will take into consideration various other factors such as whether the custodian requesting
access has policies and procedures in place as per section 63(1) of the HIA, whether the
custodian’s has professional standards in place that speak to electronic records, and that
minimum security standards are in place.

What is prescribed health information?
Prescribed health information means “health information about an individual that is of a
class or type prescribed by the regulations that an authorized custodian may or must make
accessible to authorized custodians via the Alberta EHR” (section 56.1)(c)).

The HIA EHR Regulation establishes the components of “prescribed health information” to
include the following:

 • personal demographic information that uniquely identifies the individual,
 • information that uniquely identifies health service providers who provide health services to

the individual,

 • information about where health services are performed on and delivered to the individual,
 • information about key clinical events at the point of care in respect of the individual,
 • known allergies and intolerances of the individual,
 • immunizations of the individual,
 • prescription information in respect of the individual,
 • prescribed dispensing information in respect of the individual,
 • drug‑to‑drug interaction alerts in respect of the individual,
 • laboratory test results of the individual,
 • diagnostic imaging reports and tests of the individual,
 • diagnostic imaging digital images of the individual, and
 • other medical reports of the individual.

Sharing and using information
viewing and sharing information through Alberta Netcare is considered a use of that
information. This means that the concepts of collection and disclosure do not apply when
viewing or sharing information within Alberta Netcare (sections 56.5(2) and (3)). As a result,
authorized custodians who made that information available via Alberta Netcare are not held
accountable for inappropriate disclosure of that information.

HEALTH  INFORMATION  AC T  GUIDELINES  AND  PRAC TICES - 2011

CHAPTER THIRTEEN – Alberta Electronic Health Record

An authorized custodian may use the information in Alberta Netcare for any purpose that is
authorized by section 27;

An authorized custodian may use prescribed health information that is accessible via the
Alberta EHR, and that is not otherwise in the custody or under the control of that authorized
custodian, but only for the following purposes:

 • providing a health service (section 27(1)(a));
 • determining or verifying the eligibility of an individual to receive a health service

(section 27(1)(b)); or

 • carrying out any purpose authorized by an enactment of Alberta or Canada

(section 27(1)(f)).

If information is printed out or somehow taken from the Alberta Netcare context, then this may
be considered a disclosure of information from Alberta Netcare and the authorized custodian
who performs this action must do so in accordance with the disclosure provisions set out
in the HIA.

Using information in Alberta Netcare for any purpose beyond those listed above is considered
an inappropriate use and by extension, a breach of that health information. The following
audits identify inappropriate use of health information via Alberta Netcare:

 • Same last name search

It is considered an inappropriate access of Alberta Netcare to type in your own last name
and to access the information belonging to other individuals who share the same name as
you. For example, Dr. John Smith should not search Alberta Netcare for other individuals
with the surname “Smith” in order to view their health information.

 • Personal records search

It is considered an inappropriate access of Alberta Netcare to search your own health
information through Alberta Netcare. Health services providers are unable to provide
themselves with treatment and care, as a result, any access of their own health information
via Alberta Netcare is an inappropriate use.

 • Inappropriate patient search

‑  Frequent access – repeatedly accessing an individual’s health information for purposes

that are not related to providing treatment and care may be considered a breach.
Likewise any access to another individual’s health information for purposes other than
providing treatment and care may constitute a breach of that information.

‑  Friends/family – Many health professions have established guidelines that state it is
a conflict of interest to provide treatment and care to friends and family. Since access
to Netcare is based on providing health services, any access to a friend or family
member’s health information via Alberta Netcare that is not for treatment or care
purposes is considered a breach.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN – Alberta Electronic Health Record

Fines are in place in the HIA where an individual knowingly collects, uses, discloses or creates
health information in contravention of the Act. However, a special penalty is in place where a
person uses prescribed health information in contravention of section 56.4 (use of prescribed
health information via Alberta EHR). Such a person is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine
of not more than $100 000 (section 107(6.1).

Section 6 of the HIA EHR Regulation requires custodians to ensure their Electronic Health
Record Information Systems (EHRIS) have capacity to create and maintain logs containing the
following information:

 • user identification and application identification associated with an access;
 • name of user and application that performs an access;
 • role or job functions of user who performs an access;
 • date of an access;
 • time of an access;
 • actions performed by a user during an access, including, without limitation, creating,

viewing, editing and deleting information;

 • name of facility or organization at which an access is performed;
 • display screen number or reference;
 • personal health number of the individual in respect of whom an access is performed;
 • name of the individual in respect of whom an access is performed;
 • any other information required by the Minister.

This section applies only to EHRIS established after the coming into force of this section.

Section 7 of the HIA EHR Regulation imposes upon the information manager of the Alberta
EHR (i.e., Alberta Health and Wellness) the obligation to conduct an audit of the Alberta EHR
user logs each month.

 13.6

THE PROVINCIAL ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD DATA
STEWARDSHIP COMMITTEE

The Provincial Electronic Health Record Data Stewardship Committee (EHRDSC) has been
established by the Minister under section 56.7(1) of the HIA. The EHRDSC is a multi‑
disciplinary committee whose function is to make recommendations to the Minister with
respect to the rule related to access, use, disclosure and retention of prescribed health
information through the Alberta EHR.

The EHRDSC is comprised of members from various health professional bodies, as well as
AHW and AHS. At least two members of the EHRDSC must be members of the public, one of
whom must be an ethicist.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN – Alberta Electronic Health Record

The Alberta EHR is an information tool shared by a large number of authorized custodians.
To be secure and effective, an EHR must narrow the latitude of options and engage users in a
consistent manner. The Information Exchange Protocol (IEP) establishes the specific rules for
the collection, use and disclosure of information through the Alberta EHR. These rules bind
all custodians and information managers who are signatories to the Alberta EHR Information
Manager Agreement (IMA) and other legal agreements for participating in the Alberta EHR that
may be prescribed from time to time. In the case of Alberta Netcare, an IMA is signed by every
custodian with AHW acting as the information manager. Custodians who choose not to sign
the Alberta EHR Information Manager Agreement or other appropriate legal agreements may
not participate in the EHR.

The rules in the IEP neither replace nor supersede the HIA, nor imply interpretations of the Act
that have been interpreted elsewhere by legislative authority.

It is the responsibility of each custodian and other consumers of the IEP to ensure full
understanding of their obligations under the Act, and subsequent compliance when dealing
with the EHR and related health information.

The EHRDSC, established through the HIA and appointed by the Minister of Alberta Health
and Wellness, is the author of the IEP and has the authority to revise it. The EHRDSC is not a
custodian, but develops rules “on behalf” of the collective of custodians.

A custodian only receives a copy of the IEP when they sign the IMA with AHW.

INDIVIDUAL’S RIGHT TO ACCESS THEIR OWN HEALTH INFORMATION
IN ALBERTA NETCARE

As with all health information covered under the Health Information Act, an individual has the
right to request access to his/her own health information available via Alberta Netcare. Access
requests should be directed to an authorized custodian. The rules set out in Part 2 of the HIA
apply to access requests for information available via Alberta Netcare.

If an individual wants to know who has accessed his/her health information via Alberta
Netcare, the individual must submit an access requests to Alberta Health and Wellness
specifically requesting a copy of his/her access log.

In either event, the form for making an access request along with guidelines may be viewed at
the following website:

 13.8

CONSIDERING THE EXPRESSED WISHES OF AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE
CONTEXT OF ALBERTA NETCARE

Section 56.4 of the Health Information Act (HIA) states that in deciding how much information
to make accessible via the EHR, authorized custodians must consider any expressed wishes
of the individual who is the subject of that information, together with any other factors the
regulated health professional or authorized custodian considers important. Global Person Level
Masking (GPLM) has been developed for Alberta Netcare so that an individual’s information
is not readily accessible to authorized users of Alberta Netcare and is the means by which
authorized custodians may respond to requests by individuals to consider their wish to mask
their information available through Alberta Netcare.

Requesting a Mask
GPLM must be requested by an individual through a participating custodian. After discussing
the consequences of applying a mask with the patient, the custodian completes and submits a
copy of an “Application for Global Person Level Masking”. All original, completed forms should
be retained by the custodian.

Criteria for Applying a Mask
The custodian considering an individual’s masking request should have a current care
relationship with that individual that enables the custodian to confirm that masking the
information is in the individual’s best interests and that it will not compromise the protection
of public health and safety. The custodian should also establish that the decision to mask is
consistent with his/her professional practice guidelines. If the custodian decides not to mask
the individual’s record, he or she must advise the individual of their reason to deny the mask
and should retain the form with the refusal noted on the individual’s file.

Once a mask has been applied to an individual’s health information, the information contained
in an individual’s EHR will not automatically be displayed. Authorized health service providers
may unmask a record if clinically necessary and where the provider has role‑based permission,
but only in accordance with specific rules set out in the IEP. Unmasking activity may be
flagged, electronically logged, and audited.

If approved, the mask is applied to an individual’s health information within Alberta Netcare.
Global Person‑Level Masking makes accessing patient health information a two‑step process.
The health services provider must select the category (in a drop‑down menu) that legitimately
reflects the reason for the unmasking before the health information can be viewed. The six
categories are:

 • Patient Consent
 • Direct Patient Care – Clinical Need
 • Medical Emergency
 • Public Health Follow‑up
 • For Authorized Release of Patient Information
 • As Required by Law

CHAPTER THIRTEEN – Alberta Electronic Health Record

For example, every time a family doctor needs to read a patient’s lab result or report, he/
she will be required to unmask the patient’s health information. Individuals whose health
information is masked may experience minor delays in receiving treatment and care as their
health information is unmasked.

Unmasking only applies to the health services provider’s viewing of the health information for
each discrete episode. When the health services provider logs out, or the system is shut down,
the mask is reset. The unmasking of the masked health information is logged and subject to
auditing (as are all viewings through Alberta Netcare).

Note: Global Person‑Level Masking in Alberta Netcare does not mask an individual’s health
information in other electronic clinical information systems used by health services providers
in Alberta.

Rescinding a Mask
An individual may request that a mask be rescinded in the event that he/she no longer wants
his/her information masked. Furthermore, if a custodian becomes aware of circumstances
that no longer meet the conditions for masking, he/she may initiate the rescinding of a mask
(this may be a different custodian than one who authorized the masking of that individual’s
information). Reasons for rescinding a mask include: where there are consequences for public
health and safety; that mask is no longer consistent with the custodian’s relevant professional
practice guidelines; there are other compelling reasons for rescinding that mask. Custodians
should make every attempt to inform the individual of their decision prior to removal of the
mask. To rescind a mask, a participating custodian completes and submits an “Authorization to
Rescind Global Person‑Level Masking” form.

Alberta Netcare users who are unable to request a mask on a patient’s behalf, should refer
the individual to an authorized custodian with whom the individual has a continuing care
relationship for assistance.

Health Service Providers requiring assistance should contact the HIA help desk at:
780‑427‑8089 (toll free 310‑0000) or by email to: hiahelpdesk@gov.ab.ca.
