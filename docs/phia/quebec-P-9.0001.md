 The Minister may assume the operations management of a health information bank in a clinical domain
or entrust it to the Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec or another public body listed in subparagraph 5 of
the  first  paragraph  of  section  2  of  the  Act  respecting  the  governance  and  management  of  the  information
resources of public bodies and government enterprises (chapter G-1.03).

  When  the  Minister  entrusts  the  operations  management  of  a  health  information  bank  in  a  clinical

15.
domain to an operations manager, the Minister enters into a written agreement with that manager.

The agreement sets out, among other things, the operations manager’s obligation

to establish security measures to ensure the protection of health information throughout its life cycle
as well as its availability in accordance with the specific information management rules defined by the health
and social services network information officer;

(2)  to log any release of health information and to monitor the logs for any unauthorized release;

(3)

to  communicate  to  the  Minister  an  annual  report  assessing  conformity  with  the  organizational,
procedural  and  technical  rules  in  order,  among  other  things,  to  enable  the  Minister  to  validate  the  security
measures established and assess the efficiency, performance and benefits resulting from the establishment of
the clinical domains and the use of the Québec Health Record; and

(4)

to  notify  the  Minister  without  delay  of  any  violation  or  attempted  violation  of  an  obligation

concerning the confidentiality of the information released.

The Minister may demand from an operations manager any information or document considered necessary
to ensure compliance with the obligations set out in the agreement, provided that the information cannot be
associated with a person who has received health services or social services.

2012, c. 23, s. 15.

16.
 The agreement also sets out the cases and circumstances in which and the conditions under which the
operations manager of a health information bank in a clinical domain may entrust all or some of the services
dedicated to hosting, operating and using the health information bank under its management to a third person,
by means of a mandate or a service contract or contract of enterprise.

If the operations manager entrusts those services to a third person, that manager must

(1)  see that the mandate or contract is in writing;

(2)  specify, in the mandate or contract, the provisions of this Act that apply to the information released to
the mandatary or the person performing the contract, as well as the measures to be taken by the mandatary or
person  performing  the  contract  to  ensure,  among  other  things,  the  security  and  the  confidentiality  of  the
information  and  to  ensure  that  the  information  is  used  only  for  carrying  out  the  mandate  or  performing  the
contract and that it is not kept after the expiry of the mandate or contract;

(3)  before  awarding  the  mandate  or  entering  into  the  contract,  obtain  from  the  third  person  a  written
undertaking that the health information released to that person receives protection equivalent to that afforded
under this Act, and make sure that undertaking can be fulfilled; and

SHARING OF CERTAIN HEALTH INFORMATION

(4)  before  releasing  the  information,  obtain  a  written  confidentiality  agreement  from  every  person  to

whom the information may be released.

A  third  person  carrying  out  a  mandate  or  performing  a  contract  referred  to  in  the  first  paragraph  must
notify  the  operations  manager  and  the  Minister  without  delay  of  any  violation  or  attempted  violation  of  an
obligation  concerning  the  confidentiality  of  the  information  released,  and  must  also  allow  them  to  verify
compliance with confidentiality requirements.

2012, c. 23, s. 16.

17.
 When a clinical domain is made up of two or more health information banks, the Minister creates a
domain register for the purpose of identifying and locating the health information held in the different health
information  banks  concerned.  Such  a  register  must  not  contain  any  information,  other  than  that  listed  in
section 19, that makes it possible to identify a person.

The Minister may assume the operations management of such a register or entrust it to a body identified in

section 14.

2012, c. 23, s. 17.

 When the Minister entrusts the operations management of a clinical domain register to an operations

18.
manager, the Minister enters into a written agreement with that manager.

Sections 15 and 16 apply to the agreement, with the necessary modifications.

2012, c. 23, s. 18.

  The  operations  manager  of  a  health  information  bank  in  a  clinical  domain  releases  to  the  operations

19.
manager of the clinical domain register, if applicable,

(1)

the unique user identification number of the persons concerned by the information held in the bank;

and

(2)  the indexing elements necessary to identify and locate that information.

2012, c. 23, s. 19.

20.
  The  operations  manager  of  a  health  information  bank  in  a  clinical  domain  verifies  the  access
authorizations of the authorized provider or body that releases or receives health information governed by this
chapter.

Similarly, before releasing health information in accordance with this chapter through the Québec Health
Record,  the  operations  manager  verifies  in  the  register  of  refusals  whether  such  release  of  information  is
permitted.

2012, c. 23, s. 20.

21.
 The operations manager of a health information bank in a clinical domain logs the name and unique
provider number of the person who releases or receives health information governed by this chapter and the
date and time it is released or received. The operations manager also logs the name and unique identification
number of a body that releases or receives health information and the date and time it is released or received.

2012, c. 23, s. 21.

Not in force

22.
 When health information governed by this chapter is released through a source system or when such
information  is  received  through  a  source  system,  the  operations  manager  of  a  health  information  bank  in  a

date and time the information is released or received. In such cases, the manager of the source system used to

appointed under the Act respecting Access to documents held by public bodies and the Protection of personal
information (chapter A-2.1) for the purposes of this chapter must take the necessary measures to enable the
person making the request to receive the information that person is entitled to.

The  Minister  develops  a  policy  setting  out  the  access  procedures  enabling  the  person  requesting

This  section  applies  despite  the  first  paragraph  of  section  84  of  the  Act  respecting  Access  to  documents

person in charge may, before the expiry of that time, extend it by a period not exceeding 15 days. In such a
case,  the  person  in  charge  must  notify  the  person  making  the  request,  by  mail,  within  the  time  initially
granted.

enforcement of the rights provided for in this chapter, and releases to that person the information necessary
for that purpose.

The manager processes the requests received from the person in charge promptly in order to comply with
