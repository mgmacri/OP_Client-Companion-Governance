Responsibilities of Custodians and
Health Information Act
Administration Checklist

Health Information Act

APPENDIX 3

Responsibilities of Custodians in Administering the
Health Information Act

Each custodian under the Act must establish
internal processes and procedures suited to the
organization’s size, structure, specific
circumstances and anticipated workload. A
custodian’s responsibilities under the Act include:

•  receiving and responding to requests for health

information, meeting the duty to assist
applicants and collecting any fees as set out in
the Act (sections 7-10, 12, 15, 17 and 67);

•  deciding what information will be released and

what information will be excepted from
disclosure under the legislation (section 11);

•  receiving and responding to requests for

correction or amendment (sections 13-15);

•  fulfilling the various duties of the custodian

relating to the collection, use, disclosure and
protection of health information, including the
rules regarding the least amount of information
and the highest degree of anonymity (sections
18(cid:31)72);

•  responding to the Information and Privacy
Commissioner to resolve reviews and
complaints under the Act (sections 73-82, 84,
85); and

•  assisting the public by designating one or more

individuals to be responsible for the
implementation and administration of the Act
and making available any policies or
procedures regarding compliance with the Act
(sections 62 and 63).

Health Information Act Administration
Checklist For Custodians

The following issues and tasks should be
addressed by custodians when complying with the
Act. Although they are arranged for the most part in
relative priority, many of these tasks can be
completed simultaneously.

1.  Establish the structure necessary to

administer the Health Information Act

Designate a responsible person(s)

Custodians have a number of responsibilities and
requirements related to the administration of the
Health Information Act. Regardless of the size and
structure of the custodian, fulfilling these
responsibilities will require clear lines of
responsibility and coordination within each
organization.

Section 62 of the Act requires each custodian to
identify an individual who will be responsible for
implementing the Act and the regulations made
under it. This individual is also responsible for
ensuring that the necessary Health Information Act
related policies and procedures are established and
followed.

The Act provides flexibility for custodians. If the
custodian organization is large or decentralized, it
may choose to identify individuals responsible for
the Act on a site by site or geographic basis, rather
than having one person responsible for
administration. Designated individuals may be
employees or agents of the custodian. “Best

Health Information Act

practices” point to the importance of having only
one individual designated, if possible, with support
from site or area/program contacts as necessary.
The designated individual should have access to
senior staff and decision makers and the necessary
resources and support to administer the Act within
the organization.

A single individual or agent may represent several
custodians in a clinic or facility setting or in
instances where custodians do not have the
capacity to administer the Act. These arrangements
should be formalized to ensure that the scope of
responsibility is clear. As in other areas of the Act,
the custodian remains ultimately responsible for the
actions of their agents.

Establish an appropriate administration support
team

Depending on the projected volume of requests, the
amount and type of health information collected,
used or disclosed, and the size and complexity of
the organization, a custodian may wish to establish
a team to support the person responsible for
administering the Act. For example, in a large
organization such as a health authority, the team
should likely include senior representatives from the
various parts of the organization affected by the Act
(i.e. those areas that collect, use, disclose or
protect health information). It may also include a
representative from information technology and
systems, information or records management and
the legal department.

Custodians that provide a single health service or
work in a clinic will have very different support
needs. In these cases, support administering the
Act is provided by professional/regulatory bodies,
the Department and other support organizations.

Identify and communicate with other “affiliated”
custodians

Under the Act, some custodians have responsibility
for other custodians. For example, a regional health

authority has some level of responsibility for
subsidiary health corporations, community health
councils, other boards, councils, committees or
agencies that they create and hospitals and nursing
homes they fund to perform services in the region.
In these cases, the custodian should identify all the
various other custodians they are responsible for as
early as possible and take steps to determine how
to administer the Act for, or with, them.

2.  Establish a communications plan

The Department is responsible for overall
leadership and direction in communicating with the
various custodians about the Act and ensures that
appropriate information and materials are available.

In addition, each custodian should have an internal
and external communication plan in place.

The plan should include:
  key messages the custodian wishes to

communicate about its responsibilities and
activities in administering the Act; and
  activities designed to make all the patients,
clients, residents, agents, and employees
aware that the Act applies to the
custodian.

3.  Establish a training plan and conduct

awareness training

Training and awareness sessions are very
important and are a requirement under the Act.

In medium to large organizations, the training plan
should accommodate a variety of audiences and
their requirements including the following:
  site or facility contacts, program contacts
and back-up contacts (if required) require
an in-depth knowledge of the procedural
and interpretative aspects of the Act;

  senior staff require a general knowledge of
the procedural and interpretative aspects
of the Act, including its impact on the
operations of the organization;

Health and Wellness

Appendix 3 – Page 2

Health Information Act

  members of the governing authority (e.g.
boards) should understand the principles
and overall approach of the Act, its general
requirements and impact on the
organization;

  staff who have daily contact with the public
must be able to recognize and channel
both health information requests and
freedom of information (FOIP) requests, if
applicable, to the appropriate contact
points for response;

  all staff and agents of the custodian should

be aware of the existence and basic
requirements of the Act, their obligations
under the Act, the name of the person or
area(s) responsible for its administration in
the organization; and

  specific staff groups, such as human
resources staff, those responsible for
collecting health information in admitting
offices or functions, managers responsible
for internal operations and support
functions, information systems and
information management specialists, legal
advisors and others will need a detailed
understanding of the Act as it relates to
their specific area of expertise.

Training and awareness in small offices or
organizations pose different challenges. While the
person responsible for the administration of the Act
can likely be the centre of knowledge about the Act
in the short term, others in positions of responsibility
and those who interact directly with individual
patients clearly need to understand the rules in the
Act, their obligations under the Act, their
implications and the administrative requirements.

Training materials have been produced by the
Department and are available for custodians to use
in their own training programs.

4.  Assess the status quo
Custodians should periodically review their
processes for collection, use, disclosure and
protection of health information with the general
requirements of the Act in mind. The following is a
list of areas where operations may be affected as
well as key questions to ask. Once again, the size
and complexity of the organization will directly
impact the amount of effort required to consider
these areas.
Who are the affiliates of the organization?
The definition of affiliates in the Act includes a
custodian’s employees and those in a contractual or
agency relationship. A list of who falls into this
definition may change over time. Ensure that
contracts specify whether the party is an affiliate or
not based on their need to access health
information. Assess which employees or agents
have a role, or set of duties, in the office or
organization that requires them to access
identifying health information, and whether that
access needs to be blanket access, or access only
to some information in some circumstances.
Remember to provide HIA training or awareness as
required.

What are current practices?

Current practices should be periodically checked
against organizational policies to ensure they reflect
the requirements of the Act.

Consider these questions:

  Collection – What is the current authority

for collection of information? Is information
collected directly from the individual or
from other sources (If another source,
why? Under what conditions?) Is
information about the collection provided to
individuals at the time of collection
(notification)? Are hidden cameras or other
recording devices used to collect health
information?

© 2006-2011 Government of Alberta
Health and Wellness

Appendix 3 – Page 3

Health Information Act

  Access – Is individual access to health

information possible currently? Under what
authority? At what cost? How quickly does the
individual obtain access?

  Use – What is the role and mandate of the
organization in relation to those purposes
listed in Section 27 of the Act? Are some
of the purposes listed more relevant than
others? What amount and type of
information is necessary to fulfill those
purposes? Is more information collected or
used currently than may be necessary?

  Disclosure – Where is health information

disclosed? What amount and type? Under
what authority? Do the disclosure sections
of the Act (sections 35-37) appear to allow
this type of disclosure to continue? Where
required, has the individual been informed
in writing of the purpose of the disclosure
and the authority under which the
disclosure is made?

  Disposition – How and when does health
information currently get disposed of in
both hard copy and electronic form?

  Data matching – Does any data matching

or data linking activity currently take place?
If so, with whom? Does it occur on an
occasional (i.e. batch) basis or does it
occur as part of a regular process? Are
PIAs conducted where necessary?

  Security – How is health information

currently secured in both hard copy and
electronic systems? To what extent is
access controlled? Is it on a “need to
know” basis? How is information that is
transmitted or transferred secured? Are
these systems audited on a regular basis?

What are the current practices for records
management and archives?

Consider these questions:

  Do the current records and information
management systems enable the
appropriate staff to locate and retrieve
records containing health information
about an individual in a complete, accurate
and timely manner? This includes records
in all formats including paper-based files,
electronic patient files, electronic
databases and other media. It also
includes all types of files that may contain
health information about an individual
including the patient medical record,
material waiting to be transcribed or
entered into the patient record, information
about the patient that may exist in other
places (e.g. subject-based files on specific
diseases or procedures, etc.).

  What amount and type (i.e. diagnostic

treatment and care, registration and health
service provider) of health information
exists in the organization, in what format
and where? It may also be helpful to know
whether the three types of information
always exist together or whether there are
instances where one or more types exist
apart from the others. This distinction
makes it easier to determine which rules
apply to which information.

  Which records in the custody or control of
the organization are exempt from the
Health Information Act, or otherwise
covered by another Act, such as the FOIP
Act?

  What are the current records retention and
disposition practices (i.e. how long are the
various types of health information records
kept for) of the organization and what is
the basis for current practice?

  What health information has been, or will

be, provided for archival storage? If any
information is stored in archives, it is
important to be clear on who manages

Health and Wellness

Appendix 3 – Page 4

Health Information Act

How are Personal Health Numbers collected and
used?

The Health Information Act intentionally limits the
collection of Personal Health Numbers (PHNs).
Periodically assess if PHNs are used only for the
purposes for which they were collected. Is the
organization advising individuals of their authority to
collect PHNs before they request a PHN from an
individual?

Are there other legal authorities that apply?

Any one of a number of existing statutes and/or
regulations could be relevant to a custodian’s
operations. The Health Information Act allows many
existing practices to continue if they are fully
authorized by an existing statute or regulation.

What are the organization’s policies for consent?

The Health Information Act is primarily consent
based. Do staff know when consent for disclosure is
and is not required? Does the organization use a
standard consent form that includes the consent
requirements as stated in the Act?

When are privacy impact assessments required?

Is the organization planning any new information
systems, administrative practices or data matching
projects? Do the initiatives relate to the collection,
use, disclosure or storage of identifiable or non-
identifiable health information? Do those involved in
these initiatives understand the requirements of the
Act and the impact those requirements may have
on their projects?

How are the various levels of anonymity determined
and achieved?

As the Act requires custodians to collect, use or
disclose health information at the highest level of
anonymity possible to achieve the intended
authorized purpose, an organization must have

some ability to create or view information at various
levels of anonymity. What is the current level of
knowledge and ability within the organization to
transform information so it can be provided at
different levels of anonymity? Is the organization
able to acquire those services from another source?

How are contracts developed and managed?

Contractors providing services, including
information services, to the custodian are
constrained in many areas under the Act. The terms
of the contract or agreement between the parties
are important to establish roles and responsibilities
relative to the various dimensions addressed in the
Act.

5.  Develop/maintain procedures for tracking
and responding to health information
requests

The Health Information Act sets out time limits for
processing and responding to requests for health
information and corrections, calculating fees and
defending decisions and actions if there is an
appeal to the Information and Privacy
Commissioner. The person responsible for
administering the Act needs to ensure that the
organization’s policies and procedures can meet
the prescribed time limits.

Periodically assess if the organization’s procedures
and assigned responsibilities generally address:



receiving requests for health information
and corrections;

  creating a request file;

  accepting verbal and written requests;



locating and retrieving health information
records;

  administering fees;

  applying exceptions to the right of access;

  severing records;



responding to applicants;

  explaining terms, codes and abbreviations

  ensuring that the expressed wishes of

used in the records;

  closing the request file;

  preparing for a review by the Office of the
Information and Privacy Commissioner;
and

  determining what information will be
available without a request under the
Health Information Act.

6.  What is the organization’s plan for ensuring
compliance with the privacy provisions of
the Act?

The person responsible for administering the Act
must ensure that the business practices of the
organization are periodically reviewed in order to
meet the requirements of the Act. Any new
practices should be based on the provisions in the
Act and on regulations under the Act.

Business practices involving the collection, use,
disclosure, disposition and security of health
information will vary among custodians depending
on the size, complexity and administrative structure
of the organization. Do the policies, practices and
assigned responsibilities generally address:

  assessing the least amount of information

required;

  assessing the highest degree of anonymity

of information required and how
information can be transformed;

individuals are considered;

  ensuring adequate safeguards;

  ensuring accuracy of information;

  providing notification at disclosure of data

matching and authority/purpose
statements;

  providing notations of disclosure of records

of individually identifying diagnostic,
treatment and care information;

  establishing procedures for authenticating
the identity of individuals and recipients;

  providing for compulsory disclosure and

appeals;

  establishing research review processes

and agreements;

  establishing policies for collection and use

of Personal Health Numbers;

  defining employee and agent authority

regarding identifying health information;

  establishing the obligations for protecting
health information under its custody and
control; and

  assessing privacy impact of new systems,
practices and data matching proposals.

under Section 54. It does not constitute a precedent or
legal advice. Parties to the agreement need to determine
what provisions should be in such an agreement, giving
consideration to their relationship and the tasks that the
researcher will perform.

Where the researcher is an affiliate of the custodian
(employee or physician with privileges), the agreement
may need to be modified depending upon the nature of
the relationship between the custodian and the affiliate.

INTRODUCTORY MATTERS

1.  Names of parties to the agreement.

2.

Identification of lead researcher who is bound
by this agreement.

3.  Statement that the researcher has applied to

the custodian for disclosure of health
information for the research purposes (as listed
in Schedule A – application for disclosure of
health information to be used in research
including the research purpose(s)) (section 52).

the proposed research project and when
approval was granted.

6.  Statement that the custodian has decided to
disclose the health information applied for to
the researcher (section 53).

7.  Statement that the researcher will or has
obtain(ed) the consents of the individual
subjects prior to disclosure of their health
information, if obtaining consents was
recommended by the ethics committee (section
50(1)(a)).

8.  Duration of Research Project and duration of

the Research Agreement. (Could add an ability
to extend the time limits with consent of the
custodian).

RESPONSIBILITIES OF RESEARCHER

9.  The researcher agrees to comply with:



the Health Information Act and all
regulations under that Act (section
54(1)(a)(i));

  any conditions imposed by the custodian
relating to the use, protection, disclosure,
return or disposal of the health information
(section 54(1)(a)(ii)); and

  any requirements of custodian to provide

safeguards against the identification, direct
or indirect, of an individual who is the
subject of the health information (section
54(1)(a)(iii)).

10.  The researcher understands that if he/she

knowingly breaches the terms and conditions of
the research agreement, he/she is guilty of an

Appendix 4 – Page 2

Health Information Act

RESPONSIBILITIES OF CUSTODIAN

11.  The custodian agrees to disclose the research
information or data in a specific format at
specific time(s) (reference to Schedule C –
specifics of the research information (data
sources/elements) and any other information to
be disclosed).

12.  The custodian agrees to obtain consents to

contact the individuals who are the subject of
the information to obtain additional data.
(Alternatively, this clause could bar the
researcher from any further contact, depending
on the nature of the research) (section 55 or
section 54(1)(d)).

RESTRICTIONS ON USE AND
DISCLOSURE OF HEALTH INFORMATION

13.  The researcher agrees to only use the research
information (data sources/elements) and any
other information disclosed by the custodian
(reference Schedule C) for the purposes as
identified in Schedule A (section 54(1)(b)).

14.  The researcher agrees not to use or disclose
the information for any subsequent or other
purposes not identified in Schedule A without
the prior written approval of the custodian
(and/or the consent of the individual who is the
subject of the information, if required by the
custodian). The custodian may arbitrarily
